# Dashboard-specific visuals

All visualizations that are created in the context of the [render operator](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/render-operator) are available in dashboard visualizations. However, the following visualizations are only available in [Azure Data Explorer dashboards](azure-data-explorer-dashboards.md), Real-Time Dashboards, or [Azure Data Explorer web UI](/azure/data-explorer/add-query-visualization), and not with the render operator.

To learn how to customize any dashboard visuals, see [Customize Azure Data Explorer dashboard visuals](dashboard-customize-visuals.md)

For general information on dashboards in Azure Data Explorer, see [Visualize data with Azure Data Explorer dashboards](azure-data-explorer-dashboards.md).
