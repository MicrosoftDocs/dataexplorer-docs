Azure Data Explorer is a fast, fully managed data analytics service for real-time analysis on large volumes of data streaming from applications, websites, IoT devices, and more. To use Azure Data Explorer, you first create a cluster, and create one or more databases in that cluster. Then you ingest (load) data into a database so that you can run queries against it. In this article, you create a cluster and a database by using Powershell. You can run PowerShell cmdlets and scripts on Windows, Linux, or in [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview) with [Az.Kusto](/powershell/module/az.kusto/?view=azps-1.4.0#kusto) to create and configure Azure Data Explorer clusters and databases.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](includes/updated-for-az.md)]

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the Azure CLI locally, this article requires the Azure CLI version 2.0.4 or later. Run `az --version` to check your version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).

## Configure parameters

The following steps are not required if you're running commands in Azure Cloud Shell. If you're running the CLI locally, follow steps 1 & 2 to sign in to Azure and to set your current subscription:

1. Run the following command to sign in to Azure:

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

1. Set the subscription where you want your cluster to be created:

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
     Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
    ```
1. When running Azure CLI locally or in the Azure Cloud Shell, you need to install the Az.Kusto module on your device:

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
     Install-Module -Name Az.Kusto
    ```

## Create the Azure Data Explorer cluster

1. Create your cluster by using the following command:

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
     New-AzKustoCluster -ResourceGroupName testrg -Name mykustocluster -Location 'Central US' -Sku D13_v2 -Capacity 10
    ```

   |**Setting** | **Suggested value** | **Field description**|
   |---|---|---|
   | Name | *mykustocluster* | The desired name of your cluster.|
   | Sku | *D13_v2* | The SKU that will be used for your cluster. |
   | ResourceGroupName | *testrg* | The resource group name where the cluster will be created. |

    There are additional optional parameters that you can use, such as the capacity of the cluster.

1. Run the following command to check whether your cluster was successfully created:

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Get-AzKustoCluster -Name mykustocluster -ResourceGroupName testrg
    ```

If the result contains `provisioningState` with the `Succeeded` value, then the cluster was successfully created.

## Create the database in the Azure Data Explorer cluster

1. Create your database by using the following command:

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    New-AzKustoDatabase -ResourceGroupName testrg -ClusterName mykustocluster -Name mykustodatabase -SoftDeletePeriod 3650:00:00:00 -HotCachePeriod 3650:00:00:00
    ```

   |**Setting** | **Suggested value** | **Field description**|
   |---|---|---|
   | ClusterName | *mykustocluster* | The name of your cluster where the database will be created.|
   | Name | *mykustodatabase* | The name of your database.|
   | ResourceGroupName | *testrg* | The resource group name where the cluster will be created. |
   | SoftDeletePeriod | *3650:00:00:00* | The amount of time that data will be kept available to query. |
   | HotCachePeriod | *3650:00:00:00* | The amount of time that data will be kept in cache. |

1. Run the following command to see the database that you created:

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Get-AzKustoDatabase -ClusterName mykustocluster -ResourceGroupName testrg -Name mykustodatabase
    ```

You now have a cluster and a database.

## Clean up resources

* If you plan to follow our other articles, keep the resources you created.
* To clean up resources, delete the cluster. When you delete a cluster, it also deletes all the databases in it. Use the following command to delete your cluster:

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Remove-AzKustoCluster -ResourceGroupName testrg -Name mykustocluster
    ```
