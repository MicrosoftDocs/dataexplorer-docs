| Property name | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `best_effort` | `bool` | If set to `true`, allows fuzzy resolution and connectivity issues of data sources (union legs.) The set of union sources is reduced to the set of table references that exist and are accessible at the time of execution. If at least one accessible table is found, the query executes. Any failure yields a warning in the query status results but doesn't prevent the query from executing. |
| `client_max_redirect_count` | `long` | Controls the maximum number of HTTP redirects the client follows during processing. |
| `client_results_reader_allow_varying_row_widths` |`bool` |  If set to `true`, the results reader tolerates tables whose row width varies across rows. |
| `deferpartialqueryfailures` | `bool` | If set to `true`, suppresses reporting of partial query failures within the result set. |
| `materialized_view_shuffle_query` | `dynamic` | Provides a hint to use the shuffle strategy for referenced materialized views in the query. This property exclusively impacts materialized views and not any subsequent operations, such as joins, within the query. It takes an array of materialized view names and their corresponding shuffle keys. </br></br>For example, `dynamic([{ "Name": "V1", "Keys" : [ "K1", "K2" ] }])` indicates shuffling view `V1` by keys `K1` and `K2`, while `dynamic([ { "Name": "V1" } ])` shuffles view `V1` by all keys.|
| `max_memory_consumption_per_query_per_node` | `long` | Overrides the default maximum amount of memory a query can allocate per node.|
| `maxmemoryconsumptionperiterator` | `long` | Overrides the default maximum amount of memory a query operator can allocate. |
| `maxoutputcolumns` | `long` | Overrides the default maximum number of columns a query is allowed to produce. |
| `norequesttimeout` | `bool` | Sets the request timeout to its maximum value. This option can't be modified as part of a [set statement](../../query/set-statement.md). |
| `notruncation` | `bool` | Disables truncation of query results returned to the caller. |
| `push_selection_through_aggregation` | `bool` | If set to `true`, allows pushing simple selection through aggregation. |
| `query_bin_auto_at` | literal | Specifies the start value to use when evaluating the [bin_auto()](../../query/bin-auto-function.md) function. |
| `query_bin_auto_size` | literal | Specifies the bin size value to use when evaluating the [bin_auto()](../../query/bin-auto-function.md) function. |
| `query_cursor_after_default` | `string` | Sets the default parameter value for the [cursor_after()](../../query/cursor-after-function.md) function when called without parameters. |
| `query_cursor_before_or_at_default` | `string` | Sets the default parameter value for the [cursor_before_or_at()](../../query/cursor-before-or-at-function.md) function when called without parameters. |
| `query_cursor_current` | `string` | Overrides the cursor value returned by the [cursor_current()](../../query/cursor-current.md) function. |
| `query_cursor_disabled` | `bool` | Disables the usage of [cursor functions](../../management/database-cursor.md#cursor-functions) within the query context. |
| `query_cursor_scoped_tables` | `dynamic` | Lists table names to be scoped to `cursor_after_default` .. `cursor_before_or_at()` (upper bound is optional). |
| `query_datascope` | `string` | Controls the data to which the query applies. Supported values are `default`, `all`, or `hotcache`. |
| `query_datetimescope_column` | `string` | Specifies the column name for the query's datetime scope (`query_datetimescope_to` / `query_datetimescope_from`). |
| `query_datetimescope_from` | `datetime` | Sets the minimum date and time limit for the query scope. If defined, it serves as an autoapplied filter on `query_datetimescope_column`. |
| `query_datetimescope_to` | `datetime` | Sets the maximum date and time limit for the query scope. If defined, it serves as an autoapplied filter on `query_datetimescope_column`. |
| `query_distribution_nodes_span` | `int` | Controls the behavior of subquery merge. The executing node introduces an extra level in the query hierarchy for each subgroup of nodes, and this option sets the subgroup size.|
| `query_fanout_nodes_percent` | `int` | Specifies the percentage of nodes for executing fan-out. |
| `query_fanout_threads_percent` | `int` | Specifies the percentage of threads for executing fan-out. |
| `query_force_row_level_security` | `bool` | If set to `true`, enforces [row level security](../../management/row-level-security-policy.md) rules, even if the policy is disabled. |
| `query_language` | `string` | Determines how the query text should be interpreted. Supported values are `csl`, `kql`, or `sql`. This option can't be modified as part of a [set statement](../../query/set-statement.md).|

| `query_python_debug` | `bool` or `int` |  If set to `true`, generates a Python debug query for the enumerated Python node.|
| `query_results_apply_getschema` | `bool` | If set to `true`, retrieves the schema of each tabular data in the results of the query instead of the data itself. |
| `query_results_cache_force_refresh` | `bool` |If set to `true`, forces a cache refresh of query results for a specific query. Must be used in combination with `query_results_cache_max_age`, and sent via [Kusto Data ClientRequestProperties class](../netfx/client-request-properties.md), not as a [set statement](../../query/set-statement.md). |
| `query_results_cache_max_age` | `timespan` | Controls the maximum age of the cached query results that the service is allowed to return. |
| `query_results_cache_per_shard` | `bool` | If set to `true`, enables per [extent](../../management/extents-overview.md) query caching. |
| `query_results_progressive_row_count` | `long` | Provides a hint for how many records to send in each update. Takes effect only if `results_progressive_enabled` is set. |

| `queryconsistency` | `string` | Controls query consistency. Supported values are `strongconsistency`, `weakconsistency`, `weakconsistency_by_query`, `weakconsistency_by_database`, or `weakconsistency_by_session_id`. When using `weakconsistency_by_session_id`, ensure to also set the `query_weakconsistency_session_id` property. This option can't be modified as part of a [set statement](../../query/set-statement.md). |
| `request_app_name` | `string` | Specifies the request application name to be used in reporting. For example, [.show queries](../../management/show-queries-command.md). This option can't be modified as part of a [set statement](../../query/set-statement.md).|
| `request_block_row_level_security` | `bool` | If set to `true`, blocks access to tables with [row level security](../../management/row-level-security-policy.md) policy enabled. |
| `request_callout_disabled` | `bool` | If set to `true`, prevents request callout to a user-provided service. |
| `request_description` | `string` | Allows inclusion of arbitrary text as the request description. |
| `request_external_data_disabled` | `bool` | If set to `true`, prevents the request from accessing external data using the [externaldata](../../query/externaldata-operator.md) operator or external tables. |
| `request_external_table_disabled` | `bool` | If set to `true`, prevents the request from accessing external tables. |
| `request_impersonation_disabled` | `bool` | If set to `true`, prevents the service from using the caller's identity to access downstream services on behalf of the caller, including cross-cluster queries. |

| `request_readonly_hardline` |  `bool` | If set to `true`, then the request operates in a strict read-only mode. The request isn't able to write anything, and any noncompliant functionality, such as plugins, are disabled. This option can't be modified as part of a [set statement](../../query/set-statement.md).|
| `request_remote_entities_disabled` | `bool` | If set to `true`, prevents the request from accessing remote databases and remote entities. |
| `request_sandboxed_execution_disabled` | `bool` | If set to `true`, prevents the request from invoking code in the sandbox. |

| `results_v2_newlines_between_frames` |  `bool` | Adds new lines between frames in the results, in order to make it easier to parse them. |
| `servertimeout` | `timespan` | Overrides the default request timeout. This option can't be modified as part of a [set statement](../../query/set-statement.md). Instead, modify the option using the dashboard settings. |
| `truncation_max_records` | `long` | Overrides the default maximum number of records a query is allowed to return to the caller (truncation). |
| `truncationmaxsize` | `long` | Overrides the default maximum data size a query is allowed to return to the caller (truncation). This option can't be modified as part of a [set statement](../../query/set-statement.md).|
| `validatepermissions` | `bool` | Validates the user's permissions to perform the query without actually running the query. Possible results for this property are: `OK` (permissions are present and valid), `Incomplete` (validation couldn't be completed due to dynamic schema evaluation), or `KustoRequestDeniedException` (permissions weren't set). |

## How to set request properties

You can set request properties in the following ways:

* The POST body of an [HTTP request](request.md)
* A Kusto Query Language [set statement](../../query/set-statement.md)
* The set option method of the [`ClientRequestProperties` class](../netfx/client-request-properties.md)

> [!NOTE]
> The following request properties can't be set with a set statement:
>
> * `norequesttimeout`
> * `queryconsistency`
> * `query_language`
> * `query_weakconsistency_session_id`
> * `request_app_name`
> * `request_readonly`
> * `request_readonly_hardline`
> * `request_user`
> * `results_progressive_enabled`
> * `results_v2_fragment_primary_tables`
> * `servertimeout`
> * `truncationmaxsize`
