# REST API overview

This article describes how to interact with your cluster over HTTPS.

## Supported actions

The available actions for an endpoint depend on whether it's an engine endpoint or a data management endpoint. In the Azure portal cluster overview, the engine endpoint is identified as the **Cluster URI** and the data management endpoint as the **Data ingestion URI**.

|Action         |HTTP verb   |URI template           |Engine|Data Management|Authentication |
