# Role-based access control

Azure Data Explorer uses a role-based access control (RBAC) model in which [principals](../management/reference-security-principals.md) get access to resources based on their assigned roles. Roles are defined for a specific cluster, database, table, external table, materialized view, or function. When defined for a cluster, the role applies to all databases in the cluster. When defined for a database, the role applies to all entities in the database.  

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) roles, such as subscription owner or cluster owner, grant access permissions for resource administration. For data administration, you need the roles described in this document.

> [!NOTE]
> To delete a database, you need at least **Contributor** ARM permissions on the cluster. To assign ARM permissions, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal).

Real-Time Intelligence in Fabric uses a hybrid role-based access control (RBAC) model in which [principals](../management/reference-security-principals.md) get access to resources based on their assigned roles granted from one or both of two sources: Fabric, and Kusto [management commands](../management/manage-database-security-roles.md). The user will have the union of the roles granted from both sources.

Within Fabric, roles can be assigned or inherited by [assigning a role in a workspace](/fabric/get-started/roles-workspaces), or by sharing a specific [item](/fabric/get-started/share-items) based on the [item permission model](/fabric/get-started/share-items#item-permission-model).

## Fabric roles

| Role                  | Permissions granted on items             |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Workspace **Admin**       | Admin RBAC role on all items in the workspace.     |
| Workspace **Member**      | Admin RBAC role on all items in the workspace.     |
| Workspace **Contributor** | Admin RBAC role on all items in the workspace.     |
| Workspace **Viewer**      | Viewer RBAC role on all items in the workspace. |
| Item **Editor**          | Admin RBAC role on the item.                       |
| Item **Viewer**           | Viewer RBAC role on the item.                      |

Roles can further be defined on the data plane for a specific database, table, external table, materialized view, or function, by using [management commands](../management/manage-database-security-roles.md). In both cases, roles applied at a higher level (Workspace, Eventhouse) are inherited by lower levels (Database, Table).

## Roles and permissions

The following table outlines the roles and permissions available at each scope.

The **Permissions** column displays the access granted to each role.

::: moniker range="azure-data-explorer"
The **Dependencies** column lists the minimum roles required to obtain the role in that row. For example, to become a Table Admin, you must first have a role like Database User or a role that includes the permissions of Database User, such as Database Admin or AllDatabasesAdmin. When multiple roles are listed in the **Dependencies** column, only one of them is needed to obtain the role.

The **How the role is obtained** column offers ways that the role can be granted or inherited.

The **Manage** column offers ways to add or remove role principals.
