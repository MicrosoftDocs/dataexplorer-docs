# series_cosine_similarity()

Calculate the cosine similarity of two numerical vectors.

The function `series_cosine_similarity()` takes two numeric series as input, and calculates their [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity).

## Syntax

`series_cosine_similarity(`*series1*`,` *series2*`)`

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| *series1, series2* | `dynamic` |   :heavy_check_mark: | Input arrays with numeric data. |

## Returns

Returns a value of type `real` whose value is the cosine similarity of *series1* with *series2*.
In case both series length isn't equal, the longer series will be truncated to the length of the shorter one.
Any non-numeric element of the input series will be ignored.

> [!NOTE]
> If one or both input arrays are empty, the result will be `null`.
