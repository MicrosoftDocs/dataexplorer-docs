# hll_merge() (aggregation function)

Merges HLL results across the group into a single HLL value.

[!INCLUDE [data-explorer-agg-function-summarize-note](../../includes/data-explorer-agg-function-summarize-note.md)]

For more information, see the [underlying algorithm (*H*yper*L*og*L*og) and estimation accuracy](#estimation-accuracy).

> [!WARNING]
>The results of hll() and hll_merge() can be stored and later retrieved (for example, to create a daily unique users summary that can be later be used to calculate weekly counts). 
> However, the precise binary representation of these results is undocumented and may change over time. Thereâ€™s no guarantee that these functions return the same output for the same input, and one should not take a dependency on them.

## Syntax

`hll_merge` `(`*hll*`)`

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
|*hll*|string|&check;|The column name containing HLL values to merge.|

## Returns

The function returns the merged HLL values of *hll* across the group.

> [!TIP]
> Use the [dcount_hll](dcount-hllfunction.md) function to calculate the `dcount` from [hll()](hll-aggfunction.md) and [hll_merge()](hll-merge-aggfunction.md) aggregation functions.

## Example

The following example shows HLL results across a group merged into a single HLL value.

```kusto
StormEvents
| summarize hllRes = hll(DamageProperty) by bin(StartTime,10m)
| summarize hllMerged = hll_merge(hllRes)
```

**Output**

The results show only the first five results in the array.
