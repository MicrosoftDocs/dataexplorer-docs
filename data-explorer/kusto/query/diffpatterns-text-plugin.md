# diffpatterns_text plugin

Compares two datasets of string values and finds text patterns that characterize differences between the two datasets. The plugin is invoked with the [`evaluate`](evaluate-operator.md) operator.

The `diffpatterns_text` returns a set of text patterns that capture different portions of the data in the two sets. For example, a pattern capturing a large percentage of the rows when the condition is `true` and low percentage of the rows when the condition is `false`. The patterns are built from consecutive tokens separated by white space, with a token from the text column or a `*` representing a wildcard. Each pattern is represented by a row in the results.

## Syntax

`T | evaluate diffpatterns_text(`*TextColumn*, *BooleanCondition* [, *MinTokens*, *Threshold* , *MaxTokens*]`)`

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| *TextColumn* | `string` |  :heavy_check_mark: | The text column to analyze. |
| *BooleanCondition* | `string` |  :heavy_check_mark: | An expression that evaluates to a boolean value. The algorithm splits the query into the two datasets to compare based on this expression.|
| *MinTokens* | `int` | | An integer value between 0 and 200 that represents the minimal number of non-wildcard tokens per result pattern. The default is 1. |
| *Threshold* | `decimal` | | A decimal value between 0.015 and 1 that sets the minimal pattern ratio difference between the two sets. Default is 0.05. See [diffpatterns](diffpatterns-plugin.md).|
| *MaxTokens* | `int` | | An integer value between 0 and 20 that sets the maximal number of tokens per result pattern, specifying a lower limit decreases the query runtime.|

## Returns

The result of diffpatterns_text returns the following columns:

* Count_of_True: The number of rows matching the pattern when the condition is `true`.
* Count_of_False: The number of rows matching the pattern when the condition is `false`.
* Percent_of_True: The percentage of rows matching the pattern from the rows when the condition is `true`.
* Percent_of_False: The percentage of rows matching the pattern from the rows when the condition is `false`.
* Pattern: The text pattern containing tokens from the text string and '`*`' for wildcards.

> [!NOTE]
> The patterns aren't necessarily distinct and may not provide full coverage of the dataset. The patterns may be overlapping and some rows may not match any pattern.

## Example

The following example uses data from the StormEvents table in the help cluster. To access this data, sign in to [https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/help/databases/Samples](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/help/databases/Samples). In the left menu, browse to **help** > **Samples** > **Tables** > **Storm_Events**.

```kusto
StormEvents

| where EventType == "Drought" or EventType == "Extreme Cold/Wind Chill"
| evaluate diffpatterns_text(EpisodeNarrative, EventType == "Extreme Cold/Wind Chill", 2)
```
