# Tutorial: Create your first graphs in Kusto Query Language

> [!INCLUDE [applies](../../includes/applies-to-version/applies.md)] [!INCLUDE [fabric](../../includes/applies-to-version/fabric.md)] [!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer](../../includes/applies-to-version/azure-data-explorer.md)] [!INCLUDE [monitor](../../includes/applies-to-version/monitor.md)] [!INCLUDE [sentinel](../../includes/applies-to-version/sentinel.md)]

Graph semantics in Kusto enables you to model and query data as interconnected networks, making it intuitive to analyze complex relationships like organizational hierarchies, social networks, and attack paths. Unlike traditional relational queries that rely on joins, graphs use direct relationships between entities to traverse connections efficiently.

## Create a transient graph with organizational data

In this section, you'll create your first graph using sample organizational data. Transient graphs are created dynamically during query execution using the `make-graph` operator, making them perfect for ad-hoc analysis and exploration.

You'll work with a simple company structure where employees report to managers. This organizational hierarchy provides an intuitive example for understanding graph relationships:

Create the organizational graph structure using employee and reporting relationship data:

::: moniker-end

```kusto
// Create sample employee data
let employees = datatable(name:string, role:string, age:long) 
[ 
  "Alice", "CEO", 45,  
  "Bob", "Engineering Manager", 35,  
  "Carol", "Marketing Manager", 38,  
  "Dave", "Developer", 28,  
  "Eve", "Developer", 26,
  "Frank", "Marketing Specialist", 30
]; 
// Create reporting relationships
let reports = datatable(employee:string, manager:string) 
[ 
  "Bob", "Alice",  
  "Carol", "Alice",  
  "Dave", "Bob",
  "Eve", "Bob",
  "Frank", "Carol"
]; 
// Build the graph and explore it
reports 
| make-graph employee --> manager with employees on name 
| graph-to-table nodes 
```

### Output

|name|role|age|
|---|---|---|
|Alice|CEO|45|
|Bob|Engineering Manager|35|
|Carol|Marketing Manager|38|
|Dave|Developer|28|
|Eve|Developer|26|
|Frank|Marketing Specialist|30|

## Query relationships with graph-match patterns

Now you'll learn to use the `graph-match` operator to find specific patterns in your organizational graph. The `graph-match` operator searches for relationships and connections within the graph structure.

First, find all employees who directly report to Alice by matching the immediate reporting relationship pattern:

::: moniker-end

```kusto
let employees = datatable(name:string, role:string, age:long) 
[ 
  "Alice", "CEO", 45,  
  "Bob", "Engineering Manager", 35,  
  "Carol", "Marketing Manager", 38,  
  "Dave", "Developer", 28,  
  "Eve", "Developer", 26,
  "Frank", "Marketing Specialist", 30
]; 
let reports = datatable(employee:string, manager:string) 
[ 
  "Bob", "Alice",  
  "Carol", "Alice",  
  "Dave", "Bob",
  "Eve", "Bob",
  "Frank", "Carol"
]; 
reports 
| make-graph employee --> manager with employees on name 
| graph-match (alice)<-[reports]-(employee)
  where alice.name == "Alice"  
  project employee = employee.name, role = employee.role, age = employee.age
```

### Direct reports output

|employee|role|age|
|---|---|---|
|Bob|Engineering Manager|35|
|Carol|Marketing Manager|38|

Next, find all employees in Alice's entire organization, including indirect reports, using variable length edges with `*1..3` to traverse multiple levels of the hierarchy:

  project employee = employee.name, role = employee.role, reportingLevels = array_length(reports)

## Create a persistent graph model

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently in public preview. Functionality and syntax are subject to change before General Availability.

Persistent graphs are stored in the database and can be queried repeatedly without rebuilding the graph structure. You'll now create the same organizational structure as a persistent graph for better performance and reusability.

Create functions that return your sample data, then define a graph model structure:

```kusto
// Create a function that returns employee data
.create function Employees() {
    datatable(name: string, role: string, age: long)
    [
        "Alice", "CEO", 45,
        "Bob", "Engineering Manager", 35,
        "Carol", "Marketing Manager", 38,
        "Dave", "Developer", 28,
        "Eve", "Developer", 26,
        "Frank", "Marketing Specialist", 30
    ]
}

// Create a function that returns reporting relationships
.create function Reports() {
    datatable(employee: string, manager: string)
    [
        "Bob", "Alice",
        "Carol", "Alice",
        "Dave", "Bob",
        "Eve", "Bob",
        "Frank", "Carol"
    ]
}
```

Define the graph model with node and edge schemas:

````kusto
.create-or-alter graph_model OrganizationGraph ```
{
    "Schema": {
        "Nodes": {
            "Employee": {
                "name": "string",
                "role": "string",
                "age": "long"
            }
        },
        "Edges": {
            "ReportsTo": {
            }
        }
    },
    "Definition": {
        "Steps": [
            {
                "Kind": "AddNodes",
                "Query": "Employees()",
                "NodeIdColumn": "name",
                "Labels": ["Employee"]
            },
            {
                "Kind": "AddEdges",
                "Query": "Reports()",
                "SourceColumn": "employee",
                "TargetColumn": "manager",
                "Labels": ["ReportsTo"]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
````

Create a graph snapshot to materialize the model into a queryable structure:

```kusto
.make graph_snapshot OrganizationGraph_v1 from OrganizationGraph
```

## Query your persistent graph

Query the persistent graph using the same patterns as transient graphs. Find all employees who report to Alice:

```kusto
graph("OrganizationGraph")
| graph-match (alice)<-[reports]-(employee)
  where alice.name == "Alice"
  project employee = employee.name, role = employee.role, age = employee.age
```

Find all employees in Alice's organization including indirect reports:

```kusto
graph("OrganizationGraph")
| graph-match (alice)<-[reports*1..3]-(employee)
  where alice.name == "Alice"
  project employee = employee.name, role = employee.role, reportingLevels = array_length(reports)
```

Query a specific snapshot version if needed:

```kusto
graph("OrganizationGraph", "OrganizationGraph_v1")
| graph-match (alice)<-[reports*1..3]-(employee)
  where alice.name == "Alice"
  project employee = employee.name, role = employee.role
```

::: moniker-end

## Compare transient and persistent graphs

Understanding when to use each approach helps you choose the right method for your analysis needs:

| Aspect | Transient Graphs | Persistent Graphs |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Creation** | `make-graph` operator during query | `.create-or-alter graph_model` + `.make graph_snapshot` |
| **Storage** | In-memory during query execution | Stored in database |
| **Reusability** | Must rebuild for each query | Query repeatedly without rebuilding |
| **Performance** | Good for smaller datasets | Optimized for large, complex graphs |
| **Use cases** | Ad-hoc analysis, exploration | Production analytics, repeated queries |
| **Memory limits** | Limited by node memory | Can handle larger datasets |

## Clean up resources

::: moniker range="azure-data-explorer || microsoft-fabric"
If you're not going to continue using the persistent graph models, delete them with the following commands:

1. Drop the graph model:

   ```kusto
   .drop graph_model OrganizationGraph
   ```

2. Drop the helper functions:

   ```kusto
   .drop function Employees
   .drop function Reports
   ```

::: moniker-end

The transient graphs are automatically cleaned up when the query completes, so no additional cleanup is needed for those examples.
