# series_fit_2lines()

Applies a two segmented linear regression on a series, returning multiple columns.  

Takes an expression containing dynamic numerical array as input and applies a [two segmented linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmented_regression) in order to identify and quantify a trend change in a series. The function iterates on the series indexes. In each iteration, the function splits the series to two parts, fits a separate line (using [series_fit_line()](series-fit-line-function.md)) to each part, and calculates the total r-square. The best split is the one that maximized r-square; the function returns its parameters:

|Parameter  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|`rsquare`     | [R-square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination) is standard measure of the fit quality. It's a number in the range [0-1], where 1 - is the best possible fit, and 0 means the data is unordered and don't fit any line.        |
|`split_idx`     |   The index of breaking point to two segments (zero-based).      |
|`variance`     | Variance of the input data.        |
|`rvariance`     | Residual variance, which is the variance between the input data values the approximated ones (by the two line segments).        |
|`line_fit`     | Numerical array holding a series of values of the best fitted line. The series length is equal to the length of the input array. It's mainly used for charting.        |
|`right_rsquare`     | R-square of the line on the right side of the split, see [series_fit_line()](series-fit-line-function.md).        |
|`right_slope`     | Slope of the right approximated line (of the form y=ax+b).         |
|`right_interception`     |  Interception of the approximated left line (b from y=ax+b).       |
|`right_variance`    | Variance of the input data on the right side of the split.        |
|`right_rvariance`     | Residual variance of the input data on the right side of the split.        |
|`left_rsquare`     | R-square of the line on the left side of the split, see [series_fit_line()](series-fit-line-function.md).        |
|`left_slope`    | Slope of the left approximated line (of the form y=ax+b).        |
|`left_interception`     |   Interception of the approximated left line (of the form y=ax+b).      |
|`left_variance`     | Variance of the input data on the left side of the split.        |
|`left_rvariance`     | Residual variance of the input data on the left side of the split.        |

> [!NOTE]
> This function returns multiple columns an so cannot be used as an argument for another function.

## Syntax

project `series_fit_2lines(`*series*`)`

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

* Will return all mentioned above columns with the following names: series_fit_2lines_x_rsquare, series_fit_2lines_x_split_idx etc.

project (rs, si, v)=`series_fit_2lines(`*series*`)`

* Will return the following columns: rs (r-square), si (split index), v (variance) and the rest will look like series_fit_2lines_x_rvariance, series_fit_2lines_x_line_fit and etc.

extend (rs, si, v)=`series_fit_2lines(`*series*`)`

* Will return only: rs (r-square), si (split index) and v (variance).

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| *series* | `dynamic` |  :heavy_check_mark: | An array of numeric values.|

> [!TIP]
> The most convenient way of using this function is applying it to the results of [make-series](make-series-operator.md) operator.
