# graph-match operator

The `graph-match` operator searches for all occurrences of a graph pattern in an input graph source.

> [!NOTE]
> This operator is used in conjunction with the [make-graph operator](make-graph-operator.md).

## Syntax

*G* `|` `graph-match` [`cycles` `=` *CyclesOption*]  *Pattern* `where` *Constraints* `project` [*ColumnName* `=`] *Expression* [`,` ...]

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| *G* | `string` |  :heavy_check_mark: | The input graph source. |
| *Pattern* | `string` |  :heavy_check_mark: | One or more comma delimited sequences of graph node elements connected by graph edge elements using graph notations. See [Graph pattern notation](#graph-pattern-notation). |
| *Constraints* | `string` |  :heavy_check_mark: | A Boolean expression composed of properties of named variables in the *Pattern*. Each graph element (node/edge) has a set of properties that were attached to it during the graph construction. The constraints define which elements (nodes and edges) are matched by the pattern. A property is referenced by the variable name followed by a dot (`.`) and the property name. |
| *Expression* | `string` |  | The `project` clause converts each pattern to a row in a tabular result. The project expression(s) have to be scalar and reference properties of named variables defined in the *Pattern*. A property is referenced by the variable name followed by a dot (`.`) and the attribute name. |
| *CyclesOption* | `string` |  | Controls whether cycles are matched in the *Pattern*, allowed values: `all`, `none`, `unique_edges`. If `all` is specified then all cycles are matched, if `none` is specified cycles aren't matched, if `unique_edges` (default) is specified, cycles are matched but only if the cycles don't include the same edge more than once. |

### Graph pattern notation

The following table shows the supported graph notation:
  
|Element|Named variable|Anonymous|
|---|---|---|
|Node|`(`*n*`)`|`()`|
|Directed edge: left to right|`-[`*e*`]->`|`-->`|
|Directed edge: right to left|`<-[`*e*`]-`|`<--`|
|Any direction edge|`-[`*e*`]-`|`--`|
|Variable length edge|`-[`*e*`*3..5]-`|`-[*3..5]-`|

### Variable length edge

A variable length edge allows a specific pattern to be repeated multiple times within defined limits. This type of edge is denoted by an asterisk (`*`), followed by the minimum and maximum occurrence values in the format *min*`..`*max*. Both the minimum and maximum values must be [integer](scalar-data-types/int.md) scalars. Any sequence of edges falling within this occurrence range can match the variable edge of the pattern, if all the edges in the sequence satisfy the constraints outlined in the `where` clause.

### Multiple sequences (Preview)

Multiple comma delimited sequences are used to express nonlinear patterns. To describe the connection between different sequences, they have to share one or more variable name of a node. For example, to express a star pattern with a node *n* in the center of the star and connected to nodes *a*,*b*,*c* and *d* the following pattern could be used: `(`*a*`)--(`*n*`)--(`*b*`)`,`(`*c*`)--(`*n*`)--(`*d*`)`. Nore that only single connected component patterns are supported.

## Returns

The `graph-match` operator returns a tabular result, where each record corresponds to a match of the pattern in the graph.  
The returned columns are defined in the operator's `project` clause using properties of edges and/or nodes defined in the pattern. Properties and functions of properties of variable length edges are returned as a dynamic array, each value in the array corresponds to an occurrence of the variable length edge.

## Examples

### All employees in a manager's org

The following example represents an organizational hierarchy, it demonstrates how a variable length edge could be used to find employees of different levels of the hierarchy in a single query. The nodes in the graph represent employees and the edges are from an employee to their manager. After we build the graph using `make-graph`, we search for employees in `Alice`'s org that are younger than `30`.

```kusto
let employees = datatable(name:string, age:long) 
[ 
  "Alice", 32,  
  "Bob", 31,  
  "Eve", 27,  
  "Joe", 29,  
  "Chris", 45, 
  "Alex", 35,
  "Ben", 23,
  "Richard", 39,

let reports = datatable(employee:string, manager:string) 
[ 
  "Bob", "Alice",  
  "Chris", "Alice",  
  "Eve", "Bob",
  "Ben", "Chris",
  "Joe", "Alice", 
  "Richard", "Bob"
]; 
reports 
| make-graph employee --> manager with employees on name 
| graph-match (alice)<-[reports*1..5]-(employee)
  where alice.name == "Alice" and employee.age < 30
  project employee = employee.name, age = employee.age, reportingPath = reports.manager
```

**Output**

|employee|age|reportingPath|
|---|---|---|
|Joe|29|[<br>  "Alice"<br>]|
|Eve|27|[<br>  "Alice",<br>  "Bob"<br>]|
|Ben|23|[<br>  "Alice",<br>  "Chris"<br>]|

### Attack path

The following example builds a graph from the `Actions` and `Entities` tables. The entities are people and systems, and the actions describe different relations between entities. Following the `make-graph` operator that builds the graph is a call to `graph-match` with a graph pattern that searches for attack paths to the "Apollo" system.

let Actions = datatable(source:string, destination:string, action_type:string)

  "Mallory", "Alice", "attacks",  
  "Mallory", "Bob", "attacks"  
]; 
Actions

| graph-match (mallory)-[attacks]->(compromised)-[hasPermission]->(apollo) 
  where mallory.name == "Mallory" and apollo.name == "Apollo" and attacks.action_type == "attacks" and hasPermission.action_type == "hasPermission" 
  project Attacker = mallory.name, Compromised = compromised.name, System = apollo.name
```

**Output**

|Attacker|Compromised|System|
|---|---|---|
|Mallory|Bob|Apollo|

### Star pattern (Preview)

The following example is similar to the previous attack path example, but with an additional constraint: we want the compromised entity to also communicate with *Alice*. The `graph-match` pattern prefix is the same as the previous example and we add an additional sequence with the *compromised* as a link between the sequences.
