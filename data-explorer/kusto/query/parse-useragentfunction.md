# parse_user_agent()

Interprets a user-agent string, which identifies the user's browser and provides certain system details to servers hosting the websites the user visits. The result is returned as [`dynamic`](./scalar-data-types/dynamic.md). 

## Syntax

`parse_user_agent(`*user-agent-string*, *look-for*`)`

## Arguments

* *user-agent-string*: An expression of type `string`, representing a user-agent string.

* *look-for*: An expression of type `string` or `dynamic`, representing what the function should be looking for in the user-agent string (parsing target). 
The possible options: "browser", "os", "device". If only a single parsing target is required it can be passed a `string` parameter.
If two or three are required they can be passed as a `dynamic array`.

## Returns

An object of type `dynamic` that contains the information about the requested parsing targets.

Browser: Family, MajorVersion, MinorVersion, Patch                 

OperatingSystem: Family, MajorVersion, MinorVersion, Patch, PatchMinor             

Device: Family, Brand, Model

> [!WARNING]
> The function implementation is built on regex checks of the input string against a huge number of predefined patterns. Therefore the expected time and CPU consumption is high.
When the function is used in a query, make sure it runs in a distributed manner on multiple machines.
If queries with this function are frequently used, you may want to pre-create the results via [update policy](../management/updatepolicy.md), but you need to take into account that using this function inside the update policy will increase the ingestion latency.
 
## Example

```kusto
print useragent = "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; en-US) AppleWebKit/531.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) AdobeAIR/2.5.1"
| extend x = parse_user_agent(useragent, "browser") 
```

Expected result is a dynamic object:

{
  "Browser": {
    "Family": "AdobeAIR",
    "MajorVersion": "2",
    "MinorVersion": "5",
    "Patch": "1"
  }
}

```kusto
print useragent = "Mozilla/5.0 (SymbianOS/9.2; U; Series60/3.1 NokiaN81-3/10.0.032 Profile/MIDP-2.0 Configuration/CLDC-1.1 ) AppleWebKit/413 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/4"
| extend x = parse_user_agent(useragent, dynamic(["browser","os","device"])) 
```

Expected result is a dynamic object:

{
  "Browser": {
    "Family": "Nokia OSS Browser",
    "MajorVersion": "3",
    "MinorVersion": "1",
    "Patch": ""
  },
  "OperatingSystem": {
    "Family": "Symbian OS",
    "MajorVersion": "9",
    "MinorVersion": "2",
    "Patch": "",
    "PatchMinor": ""
  },
  "Device": {
    "Family": "Nokia N81",
    "Brand": "Nokia",
    "Model": "N81-3"
  }
}
