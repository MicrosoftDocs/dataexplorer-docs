# summarize operator

Produces a table that aggregates the content of the input table.

```kusto
T | summarize count(), avg(price) by fruit, supplier
```

A table that shows the number and average price of each fruit from each supplier. There's a row in the output for each distinct combination of fruit and supplier. The output columns show the count, average price, fruit and supplier. All other input columns are ignored.

```kusto
T | summarize count() by price_range=bin(price, 10.0)
```

A table that shows how many items have prices in each interval  [0,10.0], [10.0,20.0], and so on. This example has a column for the count and one for the price range. All other input columns are ignored.

## Syntax

*T* `| summarize`
      [[*Column* `=`] *Aggregation* [`,` ...]]
    [`by`
      [*Column* `=`] *GroupExpression* [`,` ...]]

## Arguments

* *Column:* Optional name for a result column. Defaults to a name derived from the expression.
* *Aggregation:* A call to an [aggregation function](summarizeoperator.md#list-of-aggregation-functions) such as `count()` or `avg()`, with column names as arguments. See the [list of aggregation functions](summarizeoperator.md#list-of-aggregation-functions).
* *GroupExpression:* An expression over the columns, that provides a set of distinct values. Typically it's either a column name that already provides a restricted set of values, or `bin()` with a numeric or time column as argument. 

> [!NOTE]
> When the input table is empty, the output depends on whether *GroupExpression*
> is used:
>
> * If *GroupExpression* is not provided, the output will be a single (empty) row.
> * If *GroupExpression* is provided, the output will have no rows.

## Returns

The input rows are arranged into groups having the same values of the `by` expressions. Then the specified aggregation functions are computed over each group, producing a row for each group. The result contains the `by` columns and also at least one column for each computed aggregate. (Some aggregation functions return multiple columns.)

The result has as many rows as there are distinct combinations of `by` values
(which may be zero). If there are no group keys provided, the result has a single
record.

To summarize over ranges of numeric values, use `bin()` to reduce ranges to discrete values.

> [!NOTE]
> * Although you can provide arbitrary expressions for both the aggregation and grouping expressions, it's more efficient to use simple column names, or apply `bin()` to a numeric column.
> * The automatic hourly bins for datetime columns is no longer supported. Use explicit binning instead. For example, `summarize by bin(timestamp, 1h)`.

## Aggregates default values

The following table summarizes the default values of aggregations:

Operator       |Default value                         
---------------|------------------------------------
 `count()`, `countif()`, `dcount()`, `dcountif()`         |   0                            
 `make_bag()`, `make_bag_if()`, `make_list()`, `make_list_if()`, `make_set()`, `make_set_if()` |    empty dynamic array              ([])          
 All others          |   null                           

 When using these aggregates over entities which includes null values, the null values will be ignored and won't participate in the calculation (see examples below).

## Examples

:::image type="content" source="images/summarizeoperator/summarize-price-by-supplier.png" alt-text="Summarize price by fruit and supplier":::

## Example

Determine what unique combinations of
`ActivityType` and `CompletionStatus` there are in a table. There are no aggregation functions, just group-by keys. The output will just show the columns for those results:

```kusto
Activities | summarize by ActivityType, completionStatus
```

|`ActivityType`|`completionStatus`
|---|---
|`dancing`|`started`
|`singing`|`started`
|`dancing`|`abandoned`
|`singing`|`completed`

## Example

Finds the minimum and maximum timestamp of all records in the Activities table. There is no group-by clause, so there is just one row in the output:

```kusto
Activities | summarize Min = min(Timestamp), Max = max(Timestamp)
```

|`Min`|`Max`
|---|---
|`1975-06-09 09:21:45` | `2015-12-24 23:45:00`

## Example

Create a row for each continent, showing a count of the cities in which activities occur. Because there are few values for "continent", no grouping function is needed in the 'by' clause:

    Activities | summarize cities=dcount(city) by continent

|`cities`|`continent`
|---:|---
|`4290`|`Asia`|
|`3267`|`Europe`|
|`2673`|`North America`|


## Example

The following example calculates a histogram for each activity
type. Because `Duration` has many values, use `bin` to group its values into 10-minute intervals:

```kusto
Activities | summarize count() by ActivityType, length=bin(Duration, 10m)
```

|`count_`|`ActivityType`|`length`
|---:|---|---
|`354`| `dancing` | `0:00:00.000`
|`23`|`singing` | `0:00:00.000`
|`2717`|`dancing`|`0:10:00.000`
|`341`|`singing`|`0:10:00.000`
|`725`|`dancing`|`0:20:00.000`
|`2876`|`singing`|`0:20:00.000`
|...

**Example for the aggregates default values**

When the input of `summarize` operator has at least one empty group-by key, it's result is empty, too.

When the input of `summarize` operator doesn't have an empty group-by key, the result is the default values of the aggregates used in the `summarize`:

```kusto
datatable(x:long)[]
| summarize any(x), arg_max(x, x), arg_min(x, x), avg(x), buildschema(todynamic(tostring(x))), max(x), min(x), percentile(x, 55), hll(x) ,stdev(x), sum(x), sumif(x, x > 0), tdigest(x), variance(x)
```

|any_x|max_x|max_x_x|min_x|min_x_x|avg_x|schema_x|max_x1|min_x1|percentile_x_55|hll_x|stdev_x|sum_x|sumif_x|tdigest_x|variance_x|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|||||||||||||||||

```kusto
datatable(x:long)[]
| summarize  count(x), countif(x > 0) , dcount(x), dcountif(x, x > 0)
```

|count_x|countif_|dcount_x|dcountif_x|
|---|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|0|

```kusto
datatable(x:long)[]
| summarize  make_set(x), make_list(x)
```

|set_x|list_x|
|---|---|
|[]|[]|

The aggregate avg sums all the non-nulls and counts only those which participated in the calculation (will not take nulls into account).

```kusto
range x from 1 to 2 step 1
| extend y = iff(x == 1, real(null), real(5))
| summarize sum(y), avg(y)
```

|sum_y|avg_y|
|---|---|
|5|5|

The regular count will count nulls: 

```kusto
range x from 1 to 2 step 1
| extend y = iff(x == 1, real(null), real(5))
| summarize count(y)
```

|count_y|
|---|
|2|

```kusto
range x from 1 to 2 step 1
| extend y = iff(x == 1, real(null), real(5))
| summarize make_set(y), make_set(y)
```

|set_y|set_y1|
|---|---|
|[5.0]|[5.0]|
