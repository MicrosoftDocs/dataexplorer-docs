## Introduction

This reference covers the fundamental concepts, functions, and operators of Graph Query Language (GQL). Graph Query Language (GQL) is built on mathematical graph theory concepts that provide a solid foundation for querying graph data. Understanding these fundamentals helps you write more effective queries and better understand how GQL processes your data. GQL also provides a rich set of functions and operators to work with graph patterns, nodes, edges, and properties.

## Fundamental concepts

This section covers the core concepts that form the foundation of graph data analysis with GQL.

### Graph patterns

Graph patterns are the core building blocks of GQL queries. They describe the structure you want to find in your graph data using a declarative syntax that mirrors the visual representation of graphs.

#### Node patterns

Node patterns specify how to match individual nodes in your graph:

```gql
(n)              -- Any node
(n:Person)       -- Node with Person label  
(n:Person&City)  -- Node with Person AND City label
(:Person)        -- Person node, don't bind variable
```

**Key concepts:**

- **Variable binding**: `(n)` creates a variable `n` that you can reference later in the query
- **Anonymous nodes**: `(:Person)` matches nodes without creating a variable
- **Label filtering**: `:Person` restricts matches to nodes with the Person label
- **Label combinations**: Use `&` for AND, `|` for OR operations

#### Edge patterns

Edge patterns define how nodes connect to each other:

```gql
-[e]->                -- Directed outgoing edge, any label
-[e:works_at]->       -- Directed edge, works_at label
-[e:knows|likes]->    -- knows OR likes edge
<-[e]-                -- Directed incoming edge
-[e]-                 -- Undirected (any direction)
```

**Key concepts:**

- **Direction**: `->` for outgoing, `<-` for incoming, `-` for any direction
- **Edge types**: Use labels like `:works_at` to filter by relationship type
- **Multiple types**: `knows|likes` matches either relationship type

#### Label expressions

Labels provide semantic meaning to nodes and edges. GQL supports complex label expressions:

```gql
:Person&Company                  -- Both Person AND Company labels
:Person|Company                  -- Person OR Company labels
:!Company                        -- NOT Company label
:(Person|!Company)&City          -- Complex expressions with parentheses
```

**Operators:**

- `&` (AND): Node must have all specified labels
- `|` (OR): Node must have at least one specified label  
- `!` (NOT): Node must not have the specified label
- `()`: Parentheses for grouping complex expressions

#### Path patterns

Path patterns describe multi-hop relationships in your graph:

```gql
(a)-[e1]->(b)-[e2]->(c)              -- 2-hop path
(a)-[e]->{2,4}(b)                    -- 2 to 4 hops
(a)-[e]->{1,}(b)                     -- 1 or more hops
(a)-[:knows|likes]->{1,3}(b)         -- 1-3 hops via knows/likes
p=()-[:works_at]->()                 -- Binding a path variable
```

**Variable-length paths:**

- `{2,4}`: Exactly 2 to 4 hops
- `{1,}`: 1 or more hops (unbounded)
- `{,3}`: Up to 3 hops
- `{5}`: Exactly 5 hops

**Path variables:**

- `p=()->()`: Captures the entire path for later analysis
- Access with `NODES(p)`, `RELATIONSHIPS(p)`, `PATH_LENGTH(p)`

#### Multiple patterns

GQL supports complex, non-linear graph structures:

```gql
(a)->(b), (a)->(c)               -- Multiple edges from same node
(a)->(b)<-(c), (b)->(d)          -- Non-linear structures
```

**Pattern composition:**

- Use commas `,` to separate multiple patterns
- All patterns must match simultaneously
- Variables can be shared across patterns

### Match modes

GQL supports different path matching modes that control how patterns are matched against graph data. These modes affect performance, result completeness, and the types of paths that are returned.

Match modes control how graph elements can be reused across pattern variables within a single MATCH clause.

#### DIFFERENT EDGES (default)

The default mode in Kusto. A matched edge cannot bind to more than one edge variable, but nodes can be reused freely.

```gql
MATCH (a)-[r1]->(b)-[r2]->(c)
-- r1 and r2 must be different edges
-- a, b, c can be the same or different nodes
```

#### REPEATABLE ELEMENTS

Allows both edges and nodes to be reused across pattern variables without restrictions.

```gql
MATCH REPEATABLE ELEMENTS (a)-[r1]->(b)-[r2]->(c)
-- r1 and r2 can be the same edge
-- a, b, c can be the same or different nodes
```

### Path modes

Path modes control which types of paths are included in results based on repetition constraints.

#### WALK (default)

The default GQL path mode. Includes all possible paths with no restrictions on node or edge repetition.

```gql
MATCH WALK (a)-[]->{1,3}(b)
-- Allows paths with repeating nodes and edges
```

#### TRAIL

Filters out paths that have repeating edges. Nodes may repeat, but each edge can only appear once per path.

```gql
MATCH TRAIL (a)-[]->{1,3}(b)
-- No edge can appear twice in the same path
-- Nodes may repeat
```

#### ACYCLIC

Filters out paths that have repeating nodes. Each node can only appear once per path.

```gql
MATCH ACYCLIC (a)-[]->{1,3}(b)
-- No node can appear twice in the same path
-- Prevents cycles entirely
```

#### SIMPLE

Same as ACYCLIC but allows the first and last nodes in the path to be the same (forming a simple cycle).

```gql
MATCH SIMPLE (a)-[]->{1,3}(b)
-- No node repetition except first/last can match
-- Currently not supported in implementation
```

### Mode combinations and Kusto cycles parameter

Different combinations of match modes and path modes map to specific Kusto `cycles` parameter values:

#### DIFFERENT EDGES mode

| Path Mode | Single Path | Multi-path ("star" pattern) |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------------|
| WALK      | `cycles=unique_edges` | `cycles=unique_edges` (only if all paths are WALK/TRAIL) |
| TRAIL     | `cycles=unique_edges` | `cycles=unique_edges` (only if all paths are WALK/TRAIL) |
| ACYCLIC   | `cycles=none` | Not supported |
| SIMPLE    | Not supported | Not supported |

#### REPEATABLE ELEMENTS mode

| Path Mode | Single Path | Multi-path ("star" pattern) |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------------|
| WALK      | `cycles=all` | `cycles=all` (only if all paths are WALK) |
| TRAIL     | `cycles=unique_edges` | Not supported |
| ACYCLIC   | `cycles=none` | Not supported |
| SIMPLE    | Not supported | Not supported |

#### Syntax examples

##### Basic path modes

```gql
-- Default (WALK with DIFFERENT EDGES)
MATCH (n)-[]->(m)
RETURN n, m

-- Explicit WALK mode
MATCH WALK (n)-[]->(m)
RETURN n, m

-- TRAIL mode - no repeating edges
MATCH TRAIL (n)-[]->{1,3}(m)
RETURN n, m

-- ACYCLIC mode - no repeating nodes
MATCH ACYCLIC (n)-[]->{1,3}(m)
RETURN n, m
```

##### Match mode combinations

```gql
-- DIFFERENT EDGES with WALK (default)
MATCH DIFFERENT EDGES WALK (n)-[]->(m)
RETURN n, m

-- REPEATABLE ELEMENTS with WALK
MATCH REPEATABLE ELEMENTS WALK (n)-[]->(m)
RETURN n, m

-- REPEATABLE ELEMENTS with TRAIL
MATCH REPEATABLE ELEMENTS TRAIL (n)-[]->(m)
RETURN n, m
```

##### Multi-pattern queries

```gql
-- Multiple WALK patterns (star pattern)
MATCH WALK (n)-[]->(a), WALK (n)-[]->(b)
RETURN n, a, b

-- Mixed path modes (both must be WALK/TRAIL for multi-path)
MATCH WALK (n)-[]->(a), TRAIL (n)-[]->(b)
RETURN n, a, b
```

### Best practices

- KQL supports dynamic types, but GQL does not clearly define how these should be handled. To avoid runtime errors, explicitly cast nested fields to their expected type (see `CAST`).

- Because GQL runs on KQL, some operations inherit KQL semantics. For instance, `COLLECT_LIST` (the GQL equivalent of `make_list`) will flatten arrays if the field is already an array. If results differ from expectations, consult the KQL documentation for the equivalent function.

### Performance optimization

Use these strategies to optimize GQL query performance in production environments:

> [!TIP]
> Start with simple patterns, then increase complexity if needed. Monitor query performance, and adjust path lengths and filters to improve results.

**Limit path matching scope**:

- Use specific label filters to reduce the search space: `MATCH (start:SpecificType)` instead of `MATCH (start)`
- Limit variable length paths with reasonable bounds: `MATCH (a)-[]->{1,3}(b)` instead of unbounded paths
- Apply `WHERE` clauses early to filter results before expensive operations.

**Use COUNT(*) for existence checks**:

If you only need to check if a pattern exists, use `COUNT(*)` instead of returning full results.

```gql
MATCH (user:User)-[:SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY]->(target)
WHERE user.id = 'user123'
RETURN COUNT(*) > 0 AS HasSuspiciousActivity
```

### Limitations

- **Reserved keywords**: Some GQL keywords can't be used as identifiers in queries. Some reserved keywords aren't immediately obvious (for example, `DATE` is a reserved keyword). If your graph data has property names that conflict with GQL reserved keywords, use different property names in your graph schema or rename them to avoid parsing conflicts.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When you design your graph schema, some common property names might conflict with GQL reserved keywords. Avoid or rename these property names.

- **No `INSERT`/`CREATE` support**: Operations to change graph structures are not supported. Instead, use KQL for all graph creation, change, and management tasks.

- **Optional matches**: Supported only for node patterns (not edges).

- **Entity equivalence checks not supported**: GQL's`(MATCH (n)-[]-(n2) WHERE n1 <> n2)` is not supported. Use explicit field comparisons instead, for example, `n.id <> n2.id`.

- **Time and timezone**: The engine operates in UTC. Datetime literals must use zoned datetime; only the UTC zone is supported via `ZONED_DATETIME("2011-12-31 23:59:59.9")`.

- **Duration granularity**: Durations support up to days and smaller units down to nanoseconds. Larger-than-day units (for example, weeks, months, years) aren't supported.

- **Traversal modes**: GQL defines configurable traversal modes for matching and paths. For `MATCH`, the modes are `'DIFFERENT EDGES'` and `'REPEATABLE EDGES'`; for `PATH`, the modes are `'WALK'`, `'TRAIL'`, `'ACYCLIC'`, and `'SIMPLE'`. The current implementation defaults to `'DIFFERENT EDGES'` and `'WALK'`, respectively.
Some combinations are not supported.

### Labels() custom GQL function

The `labels()` function shows the labels for a node or edge as an array.

**Syntax:**

`labels(`*entity*`)

**Parameters:**

- `entity`: A node or edge variable from a matched pattern.

**Returns:**

Returns an array of strings with all labels for the specified entity.

**Examples:**

Show labels for matched nodes:
<!-- csl -->
```gql
MATCH (entity)
RETURN entity.name, labels(entity)
```

#### Output

This query shows the name and all labels for each node in the graph.

| entity.name | labels(entity) |
|--|--|
| john.doe | ["User"] |
| admin.user | ["User"] |
| web-server | ["System"] |
| database | ["System"] |
| domain-controller | ["System"] |

Show labels in projections with aliases:
<!-- csl -->
```gql
MATCH (n)-[e]->(target)
RETURN n.name, labels(n) AS n_labels, labels(e) AS edge_labels, target.name
```

This query shows node names, their labels, and the labels of connecting edges.

| n.name | n_labels | edge_labels | target.name |
|--|--|--|--|
| john.doe | ["User"] | ["CAN_ACCESS"] | web-server |
| admin.user | ["User"] | ["CAN_ACCESS"] | domain-controller |
| web-server | ["System"] | ["CAN_ACCESS"] | database |
| domain-controller | ["System"] | ["CAN_ACCESS"] | database |
