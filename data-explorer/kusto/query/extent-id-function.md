# extent_id()

::: zone pivot="azuredataexplorer, fabric"

Returns a unique identifier that identifies the data shard ("extent") that the current record resides in.

Applying this function to calculated data that isn't attached to a data shard returns an empty guid (all zeros).

> **Deprecated aliases:** extentid()

## Syntax

`extent_id()`

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

## Returns

A value of type `guid` that identifies the current record's data shard,
or an empty guid (all zeros).

## Example

The following example shows how to get a list of all the data shards
that have records from an hour ago with a specific value for the
column `ActivityId`. It demonstrates that some query operators (here,
the `where` operator, and also `extend` and `project`)
preserve the information about the data shard hosting the record.

```kusto
T
| where Timestamp > ago(1h)
| where ActivityId == 'dd0595d4-183e-494e-b88e-54c52fe90e5a'
| extend eid=extent_id()
| summarize by eid
```
