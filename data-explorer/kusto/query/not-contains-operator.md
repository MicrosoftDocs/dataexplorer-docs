# !contains operator

Filters a record set for data that doesn't include a case-sensitive string. `!contains` searches for characters rather than [terms](datatypes-string-operators.md#what-is-a-term) of three or more characters. The query scans the values in the column, which is slower than looking up a term in a term index.

[!INCLUDE [contains-operator-comparison](../../includes/contains-operator-comparison.md)]

## Performance tips

[!INCLUDE [performance-tip-note](../../includes/performance-tip-note.md)]

When possible, use the case-sensitive [!contains_cs](not-contains-cs-operator.md).

Use `!has` if you're looking for a [term](datatypes-string-operators.md#what-is-a-term).

## Syntax

### Case insensitive syntax

*T* `|` `where` *Column* `!contains` `(`*Expression*`)`

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| *T* | `string` |  :heavy_check_mark:| The tabular input whose records are to be filtered.|
| *Column* | `string` |  :heavy_check_mark:| The column by which to filter.|
| *Expression* | scalar |  :heavy_check_mark:| The scalar or literal expression for which to search.|

## Returns

Rows in *T* for which the predicate is `true`.

## Example

```

**Output**
