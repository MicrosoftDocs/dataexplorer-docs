# make-graph operator

> [!INCLUDE [applies](../includes/applies-to-version/applies.md)] [!INCLUDE [fabric](../includes/applies-to-version/fabric.md)] [!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer](../includes/applies-to-version/azure-data-explorer.md)] [!INCLUDE [monitor](../includes/applies-to-version/monitor.md)] [!INCLUDE [sentinel](../includes/applies-to-version/sentinel.md)]

The `make-graph` operator builds a graph structure from tabular inputs of edges and nodes.

## Syntax

*Edges* `|` `make-graph` *SourceNodeId* `-->` *TargetNodeId* [ `with` *Nodes1* `on` *NodeId1* [`,` *Nodes2* `on` *NodeId2* ]]

*Edges* `|` `make-graph` *SourceNodeId* `-->` *TargetNodeId* [ `with_node_id=` *DefaultNodeId* ]

## Parameters

| Name            | Type     | Required           | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|----------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Edges*         | `string` | :heavy_check_mark: | The tabular source containing the edges of the graph, each row represents an edge in the graph. |
| *SourceNodeId*  | `string` | :heavy_check_mark: | The column in *Edges* with the source node IDs of the edges.                |
| *TargetNodeId*  | `string` | :heavy_check_mark: | The column in *Edges* with the target node IDs of the edges.                |
| *Nodes*         | `string` |                    | The tabular expressions containing the properties of the nodes in the graph.|
| *NodesId*       | `string` |                    | The columns with the node IDs in *Nodes*.                                   |
| *DefaultNodeId* | `string` |                    | The name of the column for the default node ID.                             |

## Returns

The `make-graph` operator returns a graph expression and has to be followed by a [graph operator](graph-operators.md#supported-graph-operators). Each row in source *Edges* expression becomes an edge with the graph with properties that are the column values of the row. Each row in the nodes tabular expression becomes a node in the graph with properties that are the column values of the row. Nodes that appear in the *Edges* table but don't have a corresponding row in the nodes tables are created as nodes with the corresponding node ID and empty properties.

> [!NOTE]
> Each node has a unique identifier. If the same node ID appears in both the *Nodes1* and *Nodes2* tables, a single node is created by merging their properties. If there are conflicting property values for the same node, one of the values is arbitrarily chosen.

Users can handle node information in three ways:

1. No node information required: `make-graph` completes with source and target.
2. Explicit node properties: Provide up to two tabular expressions using "`with` *Nodes1* `on` *NodeId1* [`,` *Nodes2* `on` *NodeId2* ]".
3. Default node identifier: Specify using "`with_node_id=` *DefaultNodeId*".

## Example

The following example builds a graph from edges and nodes tables. The nodes represent people and systems, and the edges are different relations between nodes. The `make-graph` operator builds the graph. Then, there's a call to [graph-match](graph-match-operator.md) with a graph pattern that searches for attack paths to the "Trent" system node.

```

**Output**

|Attacker|Compromised|System|
|---|---|---|
|Mallory|Bob|Trent|

## Example Default Node Id

This example builds a graph from edges only, using the "name" property as the default node identifier. This is useful when creating a graph from a tabular expression of edges, ensuring the node identifier is available for the constraints section of the subsequent [graph-match](graph-match-operator.md) operator.
