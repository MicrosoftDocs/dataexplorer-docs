# lookup operator

The `lookup` operator extends the columns of a fact table with values
looked-up in a dimension table.

```kusto
FactTable | lookup kind=leftouter (DimensionTable) on CommonColumn, $left.Col1 == $right.Col2
```

Here, the result is a table that extends the `FactTable` (`$left`) with data from `DimensionTable` (referenced by `$right`)
 by performing a lookup of each pair (`CommonColumn`,`Col`) from the former table
with each pair (`CommonColumn1`,`Col2`) in the latter table. 
For the differences between fact and dimension tables, see [fact and dimension tables](../concepts/fact-and-dimension-tables.md). 

The `lookup` operator performs an operation similar to the [join operator](joinoperator.md)
with the following differences:

* The result does not repeat columns from the `$right` table that are the basis
  for the join operation.
* Only two kinds of lookup are supported, `leftouter` and `inner`,
  with `leftouter` being the default.
* In terms of performance, the system by default assumes that the `$left` table
  is the larger (facts) table, and the `$right` table is the smaller (dimensions)
  table. This is exactly opposite to the assumption used by the `join` operator.
* The `lookup` operator automatically broadcasts the `$right` table to the `$left`
  table (essentially, behaves as if `hint.broadcast` was specified). Note that
  this limits the size of the `$right` table.

## Syntax

*LeftTable* `|` `lookup` [`kind` `=` (`leftouter`|`inner`)] `(` *RightTable* `)` `on` *Attributes*

## Arguments

* *LeftTable*: The table or tabular expression that is the basis for the lookup.
  Denoted as `$left`.

* *RightTable*: The table or tabular expression that is used to "populate"
  new columns in the fact table. Denoted as `$right`.

* *Attributes*: A comma-delimited list of one or more rules that describe how rows from
  *LeftTable* are matched to rows from *RightTable*. Multiple rules are evaluated using the `and` logical operator.
  A rule can be one of:

  |Rule kind        |Syntax                                          |Predicate                                                      |
  |-----------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
  |Equality by name |*ColumnName*                                    |`where` *LeftTable*.*ColumnName* `==` *RightTable*.*ColumnName*|
  |Equality by value|`$left.`*LeftColumn* `==` `$right.`*RightColumn*|`where` `$left.`*LeftColumn* `==` `$right.`*RightColumn        |

  > [!Note] 
  > In case of 'equality by value', the column names *must* be qualified with the applicable owner table denoted by `$left` and `$right` notations.

* `kind`: An optional instruction on how to treat rows in *LeftTable* that
  have no match in *RightTable*. By default, `leftouter` is used, which means
  all those rows will appear in the output with null values used for the
  missing values of *RightTable* columns added by the operator. If `inner`
  is used, such rows are omitted from the output. (Other kinds
  of join are not supported by the `looku`p operator.)
  
## Returns

A table with:

* A column for every column in each of the two tables, including the matching keys.
  The columns of the right side will be automatically renamed if there are name conflicts.
* A row for every match between the input tables. A match is a row selected from one table that has the same value for all the `on` fields as a row in the other table. 
* The Attributes (lookup keys) will appear only once in the output table.

 * `kind` unspecified, `kind=leftouter`

     In addition to the inner matches, there's a row for every row on the left (and/or right), even if it has no match. In that case, the unmatched output cells contain nulls.

 * `kind=inner`

     There's a row in the output for every combination of matching rows from left and right.

## Examples

```kusto
let FactTable=datatable(Row:string,Personal:string,Family:string) [
  "1", "Bill",   "Gates",
  "2", "Bill",   "Clinton",
  "3", "Bill",   "Clinton",
  "4", "Steve",  "Ballmer",
  "5", "Tim",    "Cook"
];
let DimTable=datatable(Personal:string,Family:string,Alias:string) [
  "Bill",  "Gates",   "billg",
  "Bill",  "Clinton", "billc",
  "Steve", "Ballmer", "steveb",
  "Tim",   "Cook",    "timc"
];
FactTable
| lookup kind=leftouter DimTable on Personal, Family
```

Row     | Personal  | Family   | Alias
--------|-----------|----------|--------
1       | Bill      | Gates    | billg
2       | Bill      | Clinton  | billc
3       | Bill      | Clinton  | billc
4       | Steve     | Ballmer  | steveb
5       | Tim       | Cook     | timc
