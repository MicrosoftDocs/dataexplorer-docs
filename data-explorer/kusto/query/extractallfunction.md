# extract_all()

Get all matches for a [regular expression](./re2.md) from a text string.
Optionally, retrieve a subset of matching groups.

```kusto
print extract_all(@"(\d+)", "a set of numbers: 123, 567 and 789") // results with the dynamic array ["123", "567", "789"]
```

## Syntax

`extract_all(`*regex*`,` [*captureGroups*`,`] *text*`)`

## Arguments

|Argument        |Description                                  |Required or Optional  |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------|
|regex           | A [regular expression](./re2.md). The expression must have at least one capturing group, and less than or equal to 16 capturing groups                                                         |Required              |
|captureGroups   |A dynamic array constant that indicates the capture group to extract. Valid values are from 1 to the number of capturing groups in the regular expression. Named capture groups are allowed as well (See [Examples](#examples))|Optional         |
|text            |A `string` to search                         |Required              |

## Returns

* If *regex* finds a match in *text*: Returns dynamic array including all matches against the indicated capture groups *captureGroups*, or all of capturing groups in the *regex*.
* If number of *captureGroups* is 1: The returned array has a single dimension of matched values.
* If number of *captureGroups* is more than 1: The returned array is a two-dimensional collection of multi-value matches per *captureGroups* selection, or all capture groups present in the *regex* if *captureGroups* is omitted.
* If there's no match: `null`.

## Examples

### Extract a single capture group

Returns hex-byte representation (two hex-digits) of the GUID.

```kusto
print Id="82b8be2d-dfa7-4bd1-8f63-24ad26d31449"
| extend guid_bytes = extract_all(@"([\da-f]{2})", Id) 
```

|ID|guid_bytes|
|---|---|
|82b8be2d-dfa7-4bd1-8f63-24ad26d31449|["82","b8","be","2d","df","a7","4b","d1","8f","63","24","ad","26","d3","14","49"]|

### Extract several capture groups 

Uses a regular expression with three capturing groups to split each GUID part into first letter, last letter, and whatever is in the middle.

```kusto
print Id="82b8be2d-dfa7-4bd1-8f63-24ad26d31449"
| extend guid_bytes = extract_all(@"(\w)(\w+)(\w)", Id)
```

|ID|guid_bytes|
|---|---|
|82b8be2d-dfa7-4bd1-8f63-24ad26d31449|[["8","2b8be2","d"],["d","fa","7"],["4","bd","1"],["8","f6","3"],["2","4ad26d3144","9"]]|

### Extract a subset of capture groups

Shows how to select a subset of capturing groups. 
The regular expression matches the first letter, last letter, and all the rest. 
The *captureGroups* parameter is used to select only the first and the last parts.

```kusto
print Id="82b8be2d-dfa7-4bd1-8f63-24ad26d31449"
| extend guid_bytes = extract_all(@"(\w)(\w+)(\w)", dynamic([1,3]), Id) 
```

|ID|guid_bytes|
|---|---|
|82b8be2d-dfa7-4bd1-8f63-24ad26d31449|[["8","d"],["d","7"],["4","1"],["8","3"],["2","9"]]|

### Using named capture groups

You can use named capture groups of RE2 in extract_all().
The *captureGroups* uses both capture group indexes and named capture group reference to fetch matching values.

```kusto
print Id="82b8be2d-dfa7-4bd1-8f63-24ad26d31449"
| extend guid_bytes = extract_all(@"(?P<first>\w)(?P<middle>\w+)(?P<last>\w)", dynamic(['first',2,'last']), Id) 
```

|ID|guid_bytes|
|---|---|
|82b8be2d-dfa7-4bd1-8f63-24ad26d31449|[["8","2b8be2","d"],["d","fa","7"],["4","bd","1"],["8","f6","3"],["2","4ad26d3144","9"]]|
