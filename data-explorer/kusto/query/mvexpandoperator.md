# mv-expand operator

Expands multi-value array or property bag.

`mv-expand` is applied on a [dynamic](./scalar-data-types/dynamic.md)-typed array or property bag column so that each value in the collection gets a separate row. All the other columns in an expanded row are duplicated. 

## Syntax

*T* `| mv-expand ` [`bagexpansion=`(`bag` | `array`)] [`with_itemindex=`*IndexColumnName*] *ColumnName* [`,` *ColumnName* ...] [`limit` *Rowlimit*]

*T* `| mv-expand ` [`bagexpansion=`(`bag` | `array`)] [*Name* `=`] *ArrayExpression* [`to typeof(`*Typename*`)`] [, [*Name* `=`] *ArrayExpression* [`to typeof(`*Typename*`)`] ...] [`limit` *Rowlimit*]

## Arguments

* *ColumnName:* In the result, arrays in the named column are expanded to multiple rows. 
* *ArrayExpression:* An expression yielding an array. If this form is used, a new column is added and the existing one is preserved.
* *Name:* A name for the new column.
* *Typename:* Indicates the underlying type of the array's elements, which becomes the type of the column produced by the operator. Nonconforming values in the array won't be converted. Instead, these values will take on a `null` value.
* *RowLimit:* The maximum number of rows generated from each original row. The default is 2147483647. 

  > [!Note]
  > The legacy and obsolete form of the operator `mvexpand` has a default row limit of 128.

* *IndexColumnName:* If `with_itemindex` is specified, the output will include an additional column (named *IndexColumnName*), which contains the index (starting at 0) of the item in the original expanded collection. 

## Returns

Multiple rows for each of the values in any array that are in the named column or in the array expression.
If several columns or expressions are specified, they're expanded in parallel. For each input row, there will be as many output rows as there are elements in the longest expanded expression (shorter lists are padded with nulls). If the value in a row is an empty array, the row expands to nothing (won't show in the result set). However, if the value in a row isn't an array, the row is kept as is in the result set. 

The expanded column always has dynamic type. Use a cast such as `todatetime()` or `tolong()` if you want to compute or aggregate values.

Two modes of property-bag expansions are supported:
* `bagexpansion=bag`: Property bags are expanded into single-entry property bags. This mode is the default expansion.
* `bagexpansion=array`: Property bags are expanded into two-element `[`*key*`,`*value*`]` array structures,
  allowing uniform access to keys and values (also, for example, running a distinct-count aggregation
  over property names). 

## Examples

### Single Column

A simple expansion of a single column:

<!-- csl: https://help.kusto.windows.net:443/Samples -->
 ```kusto
datatable (a:int, b:dynamic)[1,dynamic({"prop1":"a", "prop2":"b"})]
| mv-expand b 
```

|a|b|
|---|---|
|1|{"prop1":"a"}|
|1|{"prop2":"b"}|

### Zipped two columns

Expanding two columns will first 'zip' the applicable columns and then expand them:

<!-- csl: https://help.kusto.windows.net:443/Samples -->
```kusto
datatable (a:int, b:dynamic, c:dynamic)[1,dynamic({"prop1":"a", "prop2":"b"}), dynamic([5, 4, 3])]
| mv-expand b, c
```

|a|b|c|
|---|---|---|
|1|{"prop1":"a"}|5|
|1|{"prop2":"b"}|4|
|1||3|

### Cartesian product of two columns

If you want to get a Cartesian product of expanding two columns, expand one after the other:

<!-- csl: https://kuskusdfv3.kusto.windows.net/Kuskus -->
```kusto
datatable (a:int, b:dynamic, c:dynamic)
  [
  1,
  dynamic({"prop1":"a", "prop2":"b"}),
  dynamic([5, 6])
  ]
| mv-expand b
| mv-expand c
```

|a|b|c|
|---|---|---|
|1|{  "prop1": "a"}|5|
|1|{  "prop1": "a"}|6|
|1|{  "prop2": "b"}|5|
|1|{  "prop2": "b"}|6|

### Convert output

If you want to force the output of an mv-expand to a certain type (default is dynamic), use `to typeof`:

<!-- csl: https://help.kusto.windows.net:443/Samples -->
```kusto
datatable (a:string, b:dynamic, c:dynamic)["Constant", dynamic([1,2,3,4]), dynamic([6,7,8,9])]
| mv-expand b, c to typeof(int)
| getschema 
```

ColumnName|ColumnOrdinal|DateType|ColumnType
-|-|-|-
a|0|System.String|string
b|1|System.Object|dynamic
c|2|System.Int32|int

Notice column `b` is coming out as `dynamic` while `c` is coming out as `int`.

### Using with_itemindex

Expansion of an array with `with_itemindex`:

<!-- csl: https://help.kusto.windows.net:443/Samples -->
```kusto
range x from 1 to 4 step 1
| summarize x = make_list(x)
| mv-expand with_itemindex=Index x
```

|x|Index|
|---|---|
|1|0|
|2|1|
|3|2|
|4|3|
