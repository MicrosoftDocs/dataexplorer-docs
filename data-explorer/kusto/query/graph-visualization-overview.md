Graph visualization is essential for understanding complex relationships and patterns within interconnected data. KQL graph semantics provide powerful querying capabilities, and there are several approaches available for visualizing the results.

## Kusto Explorer

[Kusto Explorer](graph-visualization-kusto-explorer.md) provides built-in graph visualization capabilities that automatically render interactive graph visualizations when your KQL queries end with the [`make-graph`](make-graph-operator.md) operator or use the [`graph()`](graph-function.md) function.

## Graphistry

[Graphistry](graph-visualization-graphistry.md) offers GPU-accelerated graph visualization and analytics that integrates with KQL graph semantics. This platform enables interactive exploration of large-scale graph datasets with advanced visual analytics capabilities.

## Custom graph visualizations

[Custom graph visualization approaches](graph-visualization-custom.md) provide complete control over the visualization experience, enabling you to create tailored solutions using popular visualization libraries. Two primary approaches are available: Plotly-based visualizations using Python integration through KQL `evaluate python()` operator with interactive plotting capabilities, and D3.js-based visualizations using JavaScript with complete customization of visual appearance and behavior.
