# series_decompose_forecast()

Forecast based on series decomposition.

Takes an expression containing a series (dynamic numerical array) as input, and predicts the values of the last trailing points. For more information, see [series_decompose](series-decomposefunction.md).
 
## Syntax

`series_decompose_forecast(`*Series* `,` *Points* `[,` *Seasonality*`,` *Trend*`,` *Seasonality_threshold*`])`

## Arguments

* *Series*: Dynamic array cell of numeric values. Typically, the resulting output of [make-series](make-seriesoperator.md) or [make_list](makelist-aggfunction.md) operators.
* *Points*: Integer specifying the number of points at the end of the series to predict (forecast). These points are excluded from the learning (regression) process.
* *Seasonality*: An integer controlling the seasonal analysis, containing one of:
    * -1: Autodetect seasonality using [series_periods_detect](series-periods-detectfunction.md) (default).
    * period: Positive integer, specifying the expected period in number of bins. For example, if the series is in 1h bins, a weekly period is 168 bins.
    * 0: No seasonality (skip extracting this component).
* *Trend*: A string controlling the trend analysis, containing one of:
    * `linefit`: Extract trend component using linear regression (default).
    * `avg`: Define trend component as average(x).
    * `none`: No trend, skip extracting this component.
* *Seasonality_threshold*: The threshold for seasonality score when *Seasonality* is set to autodetect. The default score threshold is `0.6`. For more information, see [series_periods_detect](series-periods-detectfunction.md).

**Return**

 A dynamic array with the forecasted series.

> [!NOTE]
> * The dynamic array of the original input series should include a number of *points* slots to be forecasted. The forecast is typically done by using [make-series](make-seriesoperator.md) and specifying the end time in the range that includes the timeframe to forecast.
> * Either seasonality or trend should be enabled, otherwise the function is redundant, and just returns a series filled with zeroes.

## Example

In the following example, we generate a series of four weeks in an hourly grain, with weekly seasonality and a small upward trend. We then use `make-series` and add another empty week to the series. `series_decompose_forecast` is called with a week (24*7 points), and it automatically detects the seasonality and trend, and generates a forecast of the entire five-week period.

| extend y = 2*rand() + iff((t/24)%7>=5, 5.0, 15.0) - (((t%24)/10)*((t%24)/10)) + t/72.0 // generate a series with weekly seasonality and ongoing trend
| extend y=iff(t==150 or t==200 or t==780, y-8.0, y) // add some dip outliers
| extend y=iff(t==300 or t==400 or t==600, y+8.0, y) // add some spike outliers
| make-series y=max(y) on Timestamp in range(datetime(2018-03-01 05:00), datetime(2018-03-01 05:00)+24*7*5h, 1h); // create a time series of 5 weeks (last week is empty)
ts 
| extend y_forcasted = series_decompose_forecast(y, 24*7)  // forecast a week forward
| render timechart 
```
