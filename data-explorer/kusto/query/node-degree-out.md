# node_degree_out() (graph function)

> [!INCLUDE [applies](../includes/applies-to-version/applies.md)] [!INCLUDE [fabric](../includes/applies-to-version/fabric.md)] [!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer](../includes/applies-to-version/azure-data-explorer.md)]

The `node_degree_out` function calculates the *out-degree*, or number of outgoing edges, from  a node in a directed graph.

> [!NOTE]
> This function is used with the [`graph-match`](graph-match-operator.md) and [`graph-shortest-paths`](graph-shortest-paths-operator.md) operators.

## Syntax

`node_degree_out([`*node*`])`

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
|*node*|`string`| :heavy_check_mark: |The reference to a graph node variable in a graph pattern. <br> No parameters should be passed when used inside [all()](all-graph-function.md), [any()](any-graph-function.md) and [map()](map-graph-function.md) graph functions, in conjunction with [inner_nodes()](inner-nodes-graph-function.md). |

## Returns

Returns the out-degree of the input node or of all inner nodes, when used inside [all()](all-graph-function.md), [any()](any-graph-function.md) and [map()](map-graph-function.md) functions in conjunction with [inner_nodes()](inner-nodes-graph-function.md).

## Examples

The examples in this section show how to use the syntax to help you get started.

### Find paths between locations and transportation modes

The following example uses the `Locations` and `Routes` data tables to construct a graph that finds paths from a source location to a destination location through a `route`. It returns the source location name, destination location name, transportation methods along the route, the `node_degree_out`, which is the number of outgoing edges from the source node (location), and the `route_nodes_degree_out`, which are the number of outgoing edges from the inner nodes (stopover locations) along the route.

```kusto
// Locations table (nodes)
let Locations = datatable(LocationName: string, LocationType: string) [
    "New York", "City",
    "San Francisco", "City",

        route_nodes_degree_out = map(inner_nodes(route), node_degree_out())
```

**Output**

### Find employee with no managers

The following example creates a graph to represent the hierarchical relationships between employees and their managers. It uses the `graph-match` operator to find employees who report to a top-level manager who doesn't report to anyone else. It uses the `node_degree_out` function to identify the managers who don't report to any other manager.
