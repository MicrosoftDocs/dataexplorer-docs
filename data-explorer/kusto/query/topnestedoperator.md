# top-nested operator

Produces a hierarchical aggregation and top values selection, where each level is a refinement of the previous one.

```kusto
T | top-nested 3 of Location with others="Others" by sum(MachinesNumber), top-nested 4 of bin(Timestamp,5m) by sum(MachinesNumber)
```

The `top-nested` operator accepts tabular data as input, and one or more aggregation clauses.
The first aggregation clause (left-most) subdivides the input records into partitions, according
to the unique values of some expression over those records. The clause then keeps a certain number of records
that maximize or minimize this expression over the records. The next aggregation clause then
applies a similar function, in a nested fashion. Each following clause is applied to the partition produced
by the previous clause. This process continues for all aggregation clauses.

For example, the `top-nested` operator can be used to answer the following question: "For a table containing sales
figures, such as country, salesperson, and amount sold: what are the top five countries by sales? What are the top three salespeople in each of these countries?"

## Syntax

*T* `|` `top-nested` *TopNestedClause2* [`,` *TopNestedClause2*...]

Where *TopNestedClause* has the following syntax:

[*N*] `of` [*`ExprName`* `=`] *`Expr`* [`with` `others` `=` *`ConstExpr`*] `by` [*`AggName`* `=`] *`Aggregation`* [`asc` | `desc`]

## Arguments

For each *TopNestedClause*:

* *`N`*: A literal of type `long` indicating how many top values to return
  for this hierarchy level.
  If omitted, all distinct values will be returned.

* *`ExprName`*: If specified, sets the name of the output column corresponding
  to the values of *`Expr`*.

* *`Expr`*: An expression over the input record indicating which value to return
  for this hierarchy level.
  Typically it's a column reference for the tabular input (*T*), or some
  calculation (such as `bin()`) over such a column.

* *`ConstExpr`*: If specified, for each hierarchy level, 1 record will be added
  with the value that is the aggregation over all records that didn't
  "make it to the top".

* *`AggName`*: If specified, this identifier sets the column name
  in the output for the value of *Aggregation*.

* *`Aggregation`*: A numeric expression indicating the aggregation to apply
  to all records sharing the same value of *`Expr`*. The value of this aggregation
  determines which of the resulting records are "top".
  
  The following aggregation functions are supported:
   * [sum()](sum-aggfunction.md),
   * [count()](count-aggfunction.md),
   * [max()](max-aggfunction.md),
   * [min()](min-aggfunction.md),
   * [dcount()](dcountif-aggfunction.md),
   * [avg()](avg-aggfunction.md),
   * [percentile()](percentiles-aggfunction.md), and
   * [percentilew()](percentiles-aggfunction.md). Any algebraic combination of the aggregations is also supported.

* `asc` or `desc` (the default) may appear to control whether selection is actually from the "bottom" or "top" of the range of aggregated values.

## Returns

This operator returns a table that has two columns for each aggregation clause:

* One column holds the distinct values of the clause's *`Expr`* calculation (having the
  column name *ExprName* if specified)

* One column holds the result of the *Aggregation*
  calculation (having the column name *AggregationName* if specified)

## Notes

Input columns that aren't specified as *`Expr`* values aren't outputted.
To get all values at a certain level, add an aggregation count that:

* Omits the value of *N*
* Uses the column name as the value of *`Expr`*
* Uses `Ignore=max(1)` as the aggregation, and then ignore (or project-away)
   the column `Ignore`.

The number of records may grow exponentially with the number of aggregation clauses
((N1+1) \* (N2+1) \* ...). Record growth is even faster if no *N* limit is specified. Take into account that this operator may consume a considerable amount of resources.

If the distribution of the aggregation is considerably non-uniform,
limit the number of distinct values to return (by using *N*) and use the
`with others=` *ConstExpr* option to get an indication for the "weight" of all other
cases.
