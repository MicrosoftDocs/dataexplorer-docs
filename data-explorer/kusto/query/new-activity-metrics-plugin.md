# new_activity_metrics plugin

Calculates useful activity metrics (distinct count values, distinct count of new values, retention rate, and churn rate) for the cohort of `New Users`. 
Each cohort of `New Users` (all users which were 1st seen in time window) is compared to all prior cohorts. 
Comparison takes into account *all* previous time windows. For example, in the record for from=T2 and to=T3, 
the distinct count of users will be all users in T3 who were not seen in both T1 and T2. 
```kusto
T | evaluate new_activity_metrics(id, datetime_column, startofday(ago(30d)), startofday(now()), 1d, dim1, dim2, dim3)
```

## Syntax

*T* `| evaluate` `new_activity_metrics(`*IdColumn*`,` *TimelineColumn*`,` *Start*`,` *End*`,` *Window* [`,` *Cohort*] [`,` *dim1*`,` *dim2*`,` ...] [`,` *Lookback*] `)`

## Arguments

* *T*: The input tabular expression.
* *IdColumn*: The name of the column with ID values that represent user activity. 
* *TimelineColumn*: The name of the column that represent timeline.
* *Start*: Scalar with value of the analysis start period.
* *End*: Scalar with value of the analysis end period.
* *Window*: Scalar with value of the analysis window period. Can be either a numeric/datetime/timestamp value, or a string which is one of `week`/`month`/`year`, in which case all periods will be [startofweek](startofweekfunction.md)/[startofmonth](startofmonthfunction.md)/[startofyear](startofyearfunction.md) accordingly. 
* *Cohort*: (optional) a scalar constant indicating specific cohort. If not provided, all cohorts corresponding to the analysis time window are calculated and returned.
* *dim1*, *dim2*, ...: (optional) list of the dimensions columns that slice the activity metrics calculation.
* *Lookback*: (optional) a tabular expression with a set of IDs that belong to the 'look back' period

## Returns

Returns a table that has the distinct count values, distinct count of new values, retention rate, and churn rate for each 
combination of 'from' and 'to' timeline periods and for each existing dimensions combination.

Output table schema is:

|from_TimelineColumn|to_TimelineColumn|dcount_new_values|dcount_retained_values|dcount_churn_values|retention_rate|churn_rate|dim1|..|dim_n|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|type: as of *TimelineColumn*|same|long|long|double|double|double|..|..|..|

* `from_TimelineColumn` - the cohort of new users. Metrics in this record refer to all users who were first seen in this period. The decision on 
*first seen* takes into account all previous periods in the analysis period. 
* `to_TimelineColumn` - the period being compared to. 
* `dcount_new_values` - the number of distinct users in `to_TimelineColumn` which were not seen in *all* periods prior to and including `from_TimelineColumn`. 
* `dcount_retained_values` - out of all new users, first seen in `from_TimelineColumn`, the number of distinct users which were seen in `to_TimelineCoumn`.
* `dcount_churn_values` - out of all new users, first seen in `from_TimelineColumn`, the number of distinct users which were *not* seen in `to_TimelineCoumn`.
* `retention_rate` - the percent of `dcount_retained_values` out of the cohort (users first seen in `from_TimelineColumn`).
* `churn_rate` - the percent of `dcount_churn_values` out of the cohort (users first seen in `from_TimelineColumn`).

**Notes**

For definitions of `Retention Rate` and `Churn Rate` - refer to **Notes** section in 
[activity_metrics plugin](./activity-metrics-plugin.md) documentation.


## Examples

The following sample data set shows which users seen on which days. The table was generated based on a source `Users` 
table, as follows: 

```kusto
Users | summarize tostring(make_set(user)) by bin(Timestamp, 1d) | order by Timestamp asc;
```

|Timestamp|set_user|
|---|---|
|2019-11-01 00:00:00.0000000|[0,2,3,4]|
|2019-11-02 00:00:00.0000000|[0,1,3,4,5]|
|2019-11-03 00:00:00.0000000|[0,2,4,5]|
|2019-11-04 00:00:00.0000000|[0,1,2,3]|
|2019-11-05 00:00:00.0000000|[0,1,2,3,4]|

The output of the plugin for the original table is the following: 

```kusto
let StartDate = datetime(2019-11-01 00:00:00);
let EndDate = datetime(2019-11-07 00:00:00);
Users 
| evaluate new_activity_metrics(user, Timestamp, StartDate, EndDate-1tick, 1d) 
| where from_Timestamp < datetime(2019-11-03 00:00:00.0000000)
```

|R|from_Timestamp|to_Timestamp|dcount_new_values|dcount_retained_values|dcount_churn_values|retention_rate|churn_rate|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|2019-11-01 00:00:00.0000000|2019-11-01 00:00:00.0000000|4|4|0|1|0|

|7|2019-11-02 00:00:00.0000000|2019-11-02 00:00:00.0000000|2|2|0|1|0|
|8|2019-11-02 00:00:00.0000000|2019-11-03 00:00:00.0000000|0|1|1|0.5|0.5|
|9|2019-11-02 00:00:00.0000000|2019-11-04 00:00:00.0000000|0|1|1|0.5|0.5|
|10|2019-11-02 00:00:00.0000000|2019-11-05 00:00:00.0000000|0|1|1|0.5|0.5|
|11|2019-11-02 00:00:00.0000000|2019-11-06 00:00:00.0000000|0|0|2|0|1|

The following is an analysis of a few records from the output: 
* Record `R=3`, `from_TimelineColumn` = `2019-11-01`,  `to_TimelineColumn` = `2019-11-03`:
    * The users considered for this record are all new users seen on 11/1. Since this is the first period, 
    these are all users in that bin – [0,2,3,4]
    * `dcount_new_values` – the number of users on 11/3 who weren't seen on 11/1. This includes a single user – `5`. 
    * `dcount_retained_values` – out of all new users on 11/1, how many were retained until 11/3? There are three (`[0,2,4]`), 
    while `count_churn_values` is one (user=`3`). 
    * `retention_rate` = 0.75 – the three retained users out of the four new users who were first seen in 11/1. 

* Record `R=9`, `from_TimelineColumn` = `2019-11-02`,  `to_TimelineColumn` = `2019-11-04`:
    * This record focuses on the new users who were first seen on 11/2 – users `1` and `5`. 
    * `dcount_new_values` – the number of users on 11/4 who weren't seen through all periods `T0 .. from_Timestamp`. Meaning, 
    users who are seen on 11/4 but who were not seen on either 11/1 or 11/2 – there are no such users. 
    * `dcount_retained_values` – out of all new users on 11/2 (`[1,5]`), how many were retained until 11/4? There's one such user (`[1]`), 
    while count_churn_values is one (user `5`). 
    * `retention_rate` is 0.5 – the single user that was retained on 11/4 out of the two new ones on 11/2. 


### Weekly retention rate, and churn rate (single week)

The next query calculates a retention and churn rate for week-over-week window for `New Users` cohort
(users that arrived on the first week).

<!-- csl: https://help.kusto.windows.net:443/Samples -->
```kusto
// Generate random data of user activities
let _start = datetime(2017-05-01);
let _end = datetime(2017-05-31);
range Day from _start to _end  step 1d
| extend d = tolong((Day - _start)/1d)
| extend r = rand()+1
| extend _users=range(tolong(d*50*r), tolong(d*50*r+200*r-1), 1) 
| mv-expand id=_users to typeof(long) limit 1000000
// Take only the first week cohort (last parameter)
| evaluate new_activity_metrics(['id'], Day, _start, _end, 7d, _start)
| project from_Day, to_Day, retention_rate, churn_rate
```

|from_Day|to_Day|retention_rate|churn_rate|
|---|---|---|---|
|2017-05-01 00:00:00.0000000|2017-05-01 00:00:00.0000000|1|0|

### Weekly retention rate, and churn rate (complete matrix)

The next query calculates retention and churn rate for week-over-week window for `New Users` cohort. If the previous
example calculated the statistics for a single week - the below produces NxN table for each from/to combination.

<!-- csl: https://help.kusto.windows.net:443/Samples -->
```kusto
// Generate random data of user activities
let _start = datetime(2017-05-01);
let _end = datetime(2017-05-31);
range Day from _start to _end  step 1d
| extend d = tolong((Day - _start)/1d)
| extend r = rand()+1
| extend _users=range(tolong(d*50*r), tolong(d*50*r+200*r-1), 1) 
| mv-expand id=_users to typeof(long) limit 1000000
// Last parameter is omitted - 
| evaluate new_activity_metrics(['id'], Day, _start, _end, 7d)
| project from_Day, to_Day, retention_rate, churn_rate
```

### Weekly retention rate with lookback period

The following query calculates the retention rate of `New Users` cohort when taking into 
consideration `lookback` period: a tabular query with set of Ids that are used to define
the `New Users` cohort (all IDs that do not appear in this set are `New Users`). The 
query examines the retention behavior of the `New Users` during the analysis period.

<!-- csl: https://help.kusto.windows.net:443/Samples -->
```kusto
// Generate random data of user activities
let _lookback = datetime(2017-02-01);
let _start = datetime(2017-05-01);
let _end = datetime(2017-05-31);
let _data = range Day from _lookback to _end  step 1d
| extend d = tolong((Day - _lookback)/1d)
| extend r = rand()+1
| extend _users=range(tolong(d*50*r), tolong(d*50*r+200*r-1), 1) 
| mv-expand id=_users to typeof(long) limit 1000000;
//
let lookback_data = _data | where Day < _start | project Day, id;
_data
| evaluate new_activity_metrics(id, Day, _start, _end, 7d, _start, lookback_data)
| project from_Day, to_Day, retention_rate
```

|from_Day|to_Day|retention_rate|
|---|---|---|
|2017-05-01 00:00:00.0000000|2017-05-01 00:00:00.0000000|1|
