datetime_part("Day",datetime(2015-12-14))
```

## Syntax

## Arguments

* `date`: `datetime`
* `part`: `string`

Possible values of `part`: 
* Year
* Quarter
* Month
* week_of_year
* Day
* DayOfYear
* Hour
* Minute
* Second
* Millisecond
* Microsecond
* Nanosecond

## Returns

let dt = datetime(2017-10-30 01:02:03.7654321); 
print 
year = datetime_part("year", dt),
quarter = datetime_part("quarter", dt),
month = datetime_part("month", dt),
weekOfYear = datetime_part("week_of_year", dt),
day = datetime_part("day", dt),
dayOfYear = datetime_part("dayOfYear", dt),

> [!NOTE]
> `weekofyear` is an obsolete variant of `week_of_year` part. `weekofyear` was not ISO 8601 compliant; the first week of a year was defined as the week with the year's first Wednesday in it.
> `week_of_year` is ISO 8601 compliant; the first week of a year is defined as the week with the year's first Thursday in it. [For more information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Week_dates).
