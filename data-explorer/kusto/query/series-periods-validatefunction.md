# series_periods_validate()

Checks whether a time series contains periodic patterns of given lengths.  

Often a metric measuring the traffic of an application is characterized by a weekly or daily period. This period can be confirmed by running `series_periods_validate()` that checks for a weekly and daily period.

The function takes as input a column that contains a dynamic array of time series (typically the resulting output of [make-series](make-seriesoperator.md) operator), and one or more `real` numbers that define the lengths of the periods to validate.

The function outputs two columns:
* *periods*: A dynamic array that contains the periods to validate (supplied in the input).
* *scores*: A dynamic array that contains a score between 0 and 1. The score shows the significance of a period in its respective position in the *periods* array.

## Syntax

`series_periods_validate(`*x*`,` *period1* [ `,` *period2* `,` . . . ] `)`

## Arguments

* *x*: Dynamic array scalar expression that is an array of numeric values, typically the resulting output of [make-series](make-seriesoperator.md) or [make_list](makelist-aggfunction.md) operators.
* *period1*, *period2*, and so on: `real` numbers specifying the periods to validate, in units of the bin size. For example, if the series is in 1h bins, a weekly period is 168 bins.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * The minimal value for each of the *period* arguments is **4** and the maximal is half of the length of the input series. For a *period* argument outside these bounds, the output score will be **0**.
>
> * The input time series must be regular, that is, aggregated in constant bins, and is always the case if it has been created using [make-series](make-seriesoperator.md). Otherwise, the output is meaningless.
> 
> * The function accepts up to 16 periods to validate.

## Example

The following query embeds a snapshot of a month of an applicationâ€™s traffic, aggregated twice a day (the bin size is 12 hours).

If you run `series_periods_validate()` on this series to validate a weekly period (14 points long) it results in a high score, and with a **0** score when you validate a five-day period (10 points long).
