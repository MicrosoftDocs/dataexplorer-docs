# series_fit_line_dynamic()

Applies linear regression on a series, returning dynamic object.  

Takes an expression containing dynamic numerical array as input, and does [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_fitting) to find the line that best fits it. This function should be used on time series arrays, fitting the output of make-series operator. It generates a dynamic value with the following content:

* `rsquare`: [r-square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination) is a standard measure of the fit quality. It's a number in the range [0-1], where 1 is the best possible fit, and 0 means the data is unordered and doesn't fit any line
* `slope`: Slope of the approximated line (the *a*-value from *y=ax+b*)
* `variance`: Variance of the input data
* `rvariance`: Residual variance that is the variance between the input data values and the approximated ones.
* `interception`: Interception of the approximated line (the *b*-value from *y=ax+b*)
* `line_fit`: Numerical array containing a series of values of the best fit line. The series length is equal to the length of the input array. It's used mainly for charting.

This operator is similar to [series_fit_line](series-fit-line-function.md), but unlike `series-fit-line` it returns a dynamic bag.

## Syntax

`series_fit_line_dynamic(`*series*`)`

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| *series* | `dynamic` |  :heavy_check_mark: | An array of numeric values.|

> [!TIP]
> The most convenient way of using this function is by applying it to the results of [make-series](make-series-operator.md) operator.
