# series_fit_line()

Applies linear regression on a series, returning multiple columns.  

Takes an expression containing dynamic numerical array as input and does [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_fitting) to find the line that best fits it. This function should be used on time series arrays, fitting the output of make-series operator. The function generates the following columns:
* `rsquare`: [r-square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination) is a standard measure of the fit quality. The value's a number in the range [0-1], where 1 - is the best possible fit, and 0 means the data is unordered and doesn't fit any line. 
* `slope`: Slope of the approximated line ("a" from y=ax+b).
* `variance`: Variance of the input data.
* `rvariance`: Residual variance that is the variance between the input data values the approximated ones.
* `interception`: Interception of the approximated line ("b" from y=ax+b).
* `line_fit`: Numerical array holding a series of values of the best fitted line. The series length is equal to the length of the input array. The value's used for charting.

## Syntax

`series_fit_line(`*x*`)`

## Arguments

* *x*: Dynamic array of numeric values.

> [!TIP]
> The most convenient way of using this function is to apply it to the results of [make-series](make-seriesoperator.md) operator.

## Examples

<!-- csl: https://help.kusto.windows.net:443/Samples -->
```kusto
print id=' ', x=range(bin(now(), 1h)-11h, bin(now(), 1h), 1h), y=dynamic([2,5,6,8,11,15,17,18,25,26,30,30])
| extend (RSquare,Slope,Variance,RVariance,Interception,LineFit)=series_fit_line(y)
| render timechart
```
