# series_fill_linear()

Linearly interpolates missing values in a series.

Takes an expression containing dynamic numerical array as input, does linear interpolation for all instances of missing_value_placeholder, and returns the resulting array. If the beginning and end of the array contain missing_value_placeholder, then it will be replaced with the nearest value other than missing_value_placeholder. This feature can be turned off. If the whole array consists of the missing_value_placeholder, the array will be filled with constant_value, or 0 if not specified.  

## Syntax

`series_fill_linear(`*x*`[,` *missing_value_placeholder*` [,`*fill_edges*` [,`*constant_value*`]]]))`
* Will return series linear interpolation of *x* using specified parameters.
 

## Arguments

* *x*: dynamic array scalar expression, which is an array of numeric values.
* *missing_value_placeholder*: optional parameter, which specifies a placeholder for the "missing values" to be replaced. Default value is `double`(*null*).
* *fill_edges*: Boolean value, which indicates whether *missing_value_placeholder* at the start and end of the array should be replaced with nearest value. *True* by default. If set to *false*, then *missing_value_placeholder* at the start and end of the array will be preserved.
* *constant_value*: optional parameter relevant only for arrays entirely consists of *null* values. This parameter specifies a constant value to fill the series with. Default value is *0*. Setting this parameter it to `double`(*null*) will effectively leave *null* values where they are.

## Notes

* To apply any interpolation functions after [make-series](make-seriesoperator.md), specify *null* as the default value: 

    <!-- csl: https://help.kusto.windows.net:443/Samples -->
    ```kusto
    make-series num=count() default=long(null) on TimeStamp from ago(1d) to ago(1h) step 1h by Os, Browser
    ```

* The *missing_value_placeholder* can be of any type that will be converted to actual element types. As such, either `double`(*null*), `long`(*null*) or `int`(*null*) have the same meaning.
* If *missing_value_placeholder* is `double`(*null*) (or omitted, which have the same meaning) then a result may contain *null* values. Use other interpolation functions to fill these *null* values. Currently only [series_outliers()](series-outliersfunction.md) support *null* values in input arrays.
* The function preserves original type of array elements. If x contains only int or long elements, then the linear interpolation will return rounded interpolated values rather than exact ones.

## Example

<!-- csl: https://help.kusto.windows.net:443/Samples -->
```kusto
let data = datatable(arr: dynamic)
[
    dynamic([null, 111.0, null, 36.0, 41.0, null, null, 16.0, 61.0, 33.0, null, null]), // Array of double    
    dynamic([null, 111,   null, 36,   41,   null, null, 16,   61,   33,   null, null]), // Similar array of int
    dynamic([null, null, null, null])                                                   // Array with missing values only
];
data
| project arr, 
          without_args = series_fill_linear(arr),
          with_edges = series_fill_linear(arr, double(null), true),
          wo_edges = series_fill_linear(arr, double(null), false),
          with_const = series_fill_linear(arr, double(null), true, 3.14159)
