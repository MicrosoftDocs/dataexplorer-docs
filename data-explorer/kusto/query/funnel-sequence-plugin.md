# funnel_sequence plugin

Calculates distinct count of users who have taken a sequence of states, and the distribution of previous/next states that have led to/were followed by the sequence. The plugin is invoked with the [`evaluate`](evaluate-operator.md) operator.

## Syntax

*T* `| evaluate` `funnel_sequence(`*IdColumn*`,` *TimelineColumn*`,` *Start*`,` *End*`,` *MaxSequenceStepWindow*, *Step*, *StateColumn*, *Sequence*`)`

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| *T* | `string` |  :heavy_check_mark: | The input tabular expression. |
| *IdColum* | `string` |  :heavy_check_mark: | The column reference representing the ID. This column must be present in *T*.|
| *TimelineColumn* | `string` |  :heavy_check_mark: | The column reference representing the timeline. This column must be present in *T*.|
| *Start* | datetime, timespan, or long |  :heavy_check_mark: | The analysis start period.|
| *End* | datetime, timespan, or long |  :heavy_check_mark: | The analysis end period.|
| *MaxSequenceStepWindow* | datetime, timespan, or long |  :heavy_check_mark: | The value of the max allowed timespan between two sequential steps in the sequence.|
| *Step* | datetime, timespan, or long |  :heavy_check_mark: | The analysis step period, or bin. |
| *StateColumn* | `string` |  :heavy_check_mark: | The column reference representing the state. This column must be present in *T*.|
| *Sequence* | `dynamic` |  :heavy_check_mark: | An array with the sequence values that are looked up in `StateColumn`.|

## Returns

Returns three output tables, which are useful for constructing a sankey diagram for the analyzed sequence:

* Table #1 - prev-sequence-next `dcount`
  * TimelineColumn: the analyzed time window
  * prev: the prev state (may be empty if there were any users that only had events for the searched sequence, but not any events prior to it).
  * next: the next state (may be empty if there were any users that only had events for the searched sequence, but not any events that followed it).
  * `dcount`: distinct count of `IdColumn` in time window that transitioned `prev` --> `Sequence` --> `next`.
  * samples: an array of IDs (from `IdColumn`) corresponding to the row's sequence (a maximum of 128 IDs are returned).

* Table #2 - prev-sequence `dcount`
  * TimelineColumn: the analyzed time window
  * prev: the prev state (may be empty if there were any users that only had events for the searched sequence, but not any events prior to it).
  * `dcount`: distinct count of `IdColumn` in time window that transitioned `prev` --> `Sequence` --> `next`.
  * samples: an array of IDs (from `IdColumn`) corresponding to the row's sequence (a maximum of 128 IDs are returned).

* Table #3 - sequence-next `dcount`
  * TimelineColumn: the analyzed time window
  * next: the next state (may be empty if there were any users that only had events for the searched sequence, but not any events that followed it).
  * `dcount`: distinct count of `IdColumn` in time window that transitioned `prev` --> `Sequence` --> `next`.
  * samples: an array of IDs (from `IdColumn`) corresponding to the row's sequence (a maximum of 128 IDs are returned).

## Examples

### Exploring storm events

The following query looks at the table StormEvents (weather statistics for 2007) and shows which events happened before/after all Tornado events occurred in 2007.

```kusto
// Looking on StormEvents statistics: 
// Q1: What happens before Tornado event?
// Q2: What happens after Tornado event?
StormEvents
| evaluate funnel_sequence(EpisodeId, StartTime, datetime(2007-01-01), datetime(2008-01-01), 1d,365d, EventType, dynamic(['Tornado']))
```

Result includes three tables:

* Table #1: All possible variants of what happened before and after the sequence. For example, the second line means that there were 87 different events that had following sequence: `Hail` -> `Tornado` -> `Hail`

* Table #2: shows all distinct events grouped by the previous event. For example, the second line shows that there were a total of 150 events of `Hail` that happened just before `Tornado`.

|`StartTime`|`prev`|`dcount`|

* Table #3: shows all distinct events grouped by next event. For example, the second line shows that there were a total of 143 events of `Hail` that happened after `Tornado`.

|`StartTime`|`next`|`dcount`|

Now, let's try to find out how the following sequence continues:  
`Hail` -> `Tornado` -> `Thunderstorm Wind`

```kusto
StormEvents
| evaluate funnel_sequence(
               EpisodeId,
               StartTime,
               datetime(2007-01-01),
               datetime(2008-01-01),
               1d,
               365d,
               EventType, 
               dynamic(['Hail', 'Tornado', 'Thunderstorm Wind'])
           )
```

Skipping `Table #1` and `Table #2`, and looking at `Table #3`, we can conclude that sequence `Hail` -> `Tornado` -> `Thunderstorm Wind` in 92 events ended with this sequence, continued as `Hail` in 41 events, and turned back to `Tornado` in 14.

|`StartTime`|`next`|`dcount`|
|---------|-----|------|
|2007-01-01 00:00:00.0000000||92|
|2007-01-01 00:00:00.0000000|Hail|41|
|2007-01-01 00:00:00.0000000|Tornado|14|
|2007-01-01 00:00:00.0000000|Flash Flood|11|
