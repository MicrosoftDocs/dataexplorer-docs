# dcount() (aggregation function)

Returns an estimate for the number of distinct values that are taken by a scalar expression in the summary group.

> [!NOTE]
> The `dcount()` aggregation function is primarily useful for estimating the cardinality of huge sets. It trades performance for accuracy, and may return a result that varies between executions. The order of inputs may have an effect on its output.

## Syntax

... `|` `summarize` `dcount` `(`*`Expr`*[, *`Accuracy`*]`)` ...

## Arguments

* *Expr*: A scalar expression whose distinct values are to be counted.
* *Accuracy*: An optional `int` literal that defines the requested estimation accuracy. See below for supported values. If unspecified, the default value
  `1` is used.

## Returns

Returns an estimate of the number of distinct values of *`Expr`* in the group.

## Example

```kusto
PageViewLog | summarize countries=dcount(country) by continent
```

Get an exact count of distinct values of `V` grouped by `G`.

```kusto
T | summarize by V, G | summarize count() by G
```

This calculation requires a great amount of internal memory, since distinct values of `V` are multiplied by the number of distinct values of `G`.
It may result in memory errors or large execution times. 
`dcount()`provides a fast and reliable alternative:

```kusto
T | summarize dcount(B) by G | count
```

## Estimation accuracy

The `dcount()` aggregate function uses a variant of the [HyperLogLog (HLL) algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog),
which does a stochastic estimation of set cardinality. The algorithm provides a "knob" that can be used to balance accuracy and execution time per memory size:

|Accuracy|Error (%)|Entry count   |
|--------|---------|--------------|
|       0|      1.6|2<sup>12</sup>|
|       1|      0.8|2<sup>14</sup>|
|       2|      0.4|2<sup>16</sup>|
|       3|     0.28|2<sup>17</sup>|
|       4|      0.2|2<sup>18</sup>|

> [!NOTE]
> The "entry count" column is the number of 1-byte counters in the HLL implementation.

The algorithm includes some provisions for doing a perfect count (zero error), if the set cardinality is small enough:
* When the accuracy level is `1`, 1000 values are returned
* When the accuracy level is `2`, 8000 values are returned

The error bound is probabilistic, not a theoretical bound. The value is the standard deviation of error distribution (the sigma), and 99.7% of the estimations will have a relative error of under 3 x sigma.

The following image shows the probability distribution function of the relative
estimation error, in percentages, for all supported accuracy settings:
