# dcount() (aggregation function)

Calculates an estimate of the number of distinct values that are taken by a scalar expression in the summary group.

[!INCLUDE [ignore-nulls](../../includes/ignore-nulls.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The `dcount()` aggregation function is primarily useful for estimating the cardinality of huge sets. It trades accuracy for performance, and may return a result that varies between executions. The order of inputs may have an effect on its output.

[!INCLUDE [data-explorer-agg-function-summarize-note](../../includes/data-explorer-agg-function-summarize-note.md)]

## Syntax

`dcount` `(`*expr*[`,` *accuracy*]`)`

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| *expr*| `string` |  :heavy_check_mark: | The input whose distinct values are to be counted. |
| *accuracy* | `int` |   | The value that defines the requested estimation accuracy. The default value is `1`. See [Estimation accuracy](#estimation-accuracy) for supported values. |

## Returns

Returns an estimate of the number of distinct values of *expr* in the group.

## Example

This example shows how many types of storm events happened in each state.
