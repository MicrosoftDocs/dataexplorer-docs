# series_fit_2lines_dynamic()

Applies two segments linear regression on a series, returning a dynamic object.  

Takes an expression containing dynamic numerical array as input and applies [two segments linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmented_regression) in order to identify and quantify trend changes in a series. The function iterates on the series indexes. In each iteration, it splits the series to two parts, and fits a separate line using [series_fit_line()](series-fit-linefunction.md) or [series_fit_line_dynamic()](series-fit-line-dynamicfunction.md). The function fits the lines to each of the two parts, and calculates the total R-squared value. The best split is the one that maximizes R-squared. The function returns its parameters in dynamic value with the following content:

* `rsquare`: [R-squared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination) is a standard measure of the fit quality. It's a number in the range of [0-1], where 1 is the best possible fit, and 0 means the data is unordered and do not fit any line.
* `split_idx`: the index of breaking point to two segments (zero-based).
* `variance`: variance of the input data.
* `rvariance`: residual variance that is the variance between the input data values the approximated ones (by the two line segments).
* `line_fit`: numerical array holding a series of values of the best fitted line. The series length is equal to the length of the input array. It is used for charting.
* `right.rsquare`: r-square of the line on the right side of the split, see [series_fit_line()](series-fit-linefunction.md) or [series_fit_line_dynamic()](series-fit-line-dynamicfunction.md).
* `right.slope`: slope of the right approximated line (of the form y=ax+b).
* `right.interception`: interception of the approximated left line (b from y=ax+b).
* `right.variance`: variance of the input data on the right side of the split.
* `right.rvariance`: residual variance of the input data on the right side of the split.
* `left.rsquare`: r-square of the line on the left side of the split, see [series_fit_line()].(series-fit-linefunction.md) or [series_fit_line_dynamic()](series-fit-line-dynamicfunction.md).
* `left.slope`: slope of the left approximated line (of the form y=ax+b).
* `left.interception`: interception of the approximated left line (of the form y=ax+b).
* `left.variance`: variance of the input data on the left side of the split.
* `left.rvariance`: residual variance of the input data on the left side of the split.

This operator is similar to [series_fit_2lines](series-fit-2linesfunction.md). Unlike `series-fit-2lines`, it returns a dynamic bag.

## Syntax

`series_fit_2lines_dynamic(`*x*`)`

## Arguments

* *x*: Dynamic array of numeric values.  

> [!TIP]
> The most convenient way of using this function is applying it to the results of the [make-series](make-seriesoperator.md) operator.

## Example

<!-- csl: https://help.kusto.windows.net:443/Samples -->
```kusto
print id=' ', x=range(bin(now(), 1h)-11h, bin(now(), 1h), 1h), y=dynamic([1,2.2, 2.5, 4.7, 5.0, 12, 10.3, 10.3, 9, 8.3, 6.2])
| extend LineFit=series_fit_line_dynamic(y).line_fit, LineFit2=series_fit_2lines_dynamic(y).line_fit
| project id, x, y, LineFit, LineFit2
| render timechart
```
