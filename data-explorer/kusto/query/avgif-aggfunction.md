# avgif() (aggregation function)

Calculates the [average](avg-aggfunction.md) of *Expr* across the group for which *Predicate* evaluates to `true`.

* Can only be used in context of aggregation inside [summarize](summarizeoperator.md)

## Syntax

summarize `avgif(`*Expr*`, `*Predicate*`)`

## Arguments

* *Expr*: Expression that will be used for aggregation calculation. Records with `null` values are ignored and not included in the calculation.
* *Predicate*:  predicate that if true, the *Expr* calculated value will be added to the average.

## Returns

The average value of *Expr* across the group where *Predicate* evaluates to `true`.
 
## Examples

```kusto
range x from 1 to 100 step 1
| summarize avgif(x, x%2 == 0)
```
