# Broadcast join

Today, regular joins are executed on a single cluster node.
Broadcast join is an execution strategy of join that distributes the join over cluster nodes. This strategy is useful when the left side of the join is small (up to several tens of MBs). In this case, a broadcast join is more performant than a regular join.

Use the [lookup operator](lookup-operator.md) if the right side is smaller than the left side. The lookup operator runs in broadcast strategy by default when the right side is smaller than the left.

If left side of the join is a small dataset, then you may run join in broadcast mode using the following syntax (hint.strategy = broadcast):

```kusto
leftSide 
| join hint.strategy = broadcast (factTable) on key
```

The performance improvement is more noticeable in scenarios where the join is followed by other operators such as `summarize`.  See the following query for example:

```kusto
leftSide 
| join hint.strategy = broadcast (factTable) on Key
| summarize dcount(Messages) by Timestamp, Key
```
