# String operators

Kusto offers a variety of query operators for searching string data types. The following article describes the how string terms are indexed, lists the string query operators, and gives tips for optimizing performance.

## Understanding string terms

Kusto indexes all columns, including columns of type `string`. Multiple indexes are built for such columns, depending on the actual data. These indexes aren't directly exposed, but are used in queries with the `string` operators that have `has` as part of their name, such as `has`, `!has`, `hasprefix`, `!hasprefix`. The semantics of these operators are dictated by the way the column is encoded. Instead of doing a "plain" substring match, these operators match *terms*.

### What is a term? 

By default, Each `string` value is broken into maximal sequences of ASCII alphanumeric characters, and each of those sequences is made into a term.
For example, in the following `string`, the terms are `Kusto`, `WilliamGates3rd`, and the following substrings: `ad67d136`, `c1db`, `4f9f`, `88ef`, `d94f3b6b0b5a`.

```
Kusto:  ad67d136-c1db-4f9f-88ef-d94f3b6b0b5a;;WilliamGates3rd
```

Kusto builds a term index consisting of all terms that are *four characters or more*, and this index is used by `has`, `!has`, and so on. If the query looks for a term that is smaller than four characters, or uses a `contains` operator, Kusto will revert to scanning the values in the column if it can't determine a match. This method is much slower than looking up the term in the term index.

> [!TIP]
> All operators containing `has` search on indexed *terms* of four or more characters, and not on substring matches. A term is created by breaking up the string into sequences of ASCII alphanumeric characters. See [understanding string terms](#understanding-string-terms).

## Performance tips

For better performance, when there are two operators that do the same task, use the case-sensitive one.
For example:

* instead of `=~`, use `==`
* instead of `in~`, use `in`
* instead of `contains`, use `contains_cs`

For faster results, if you're testing for the presence of a symbol or alphanumeric word that is bound by non-alphanumeric characters, or the start or end of a field, use `has` or `in`. 
`has` works faster than `contains`, `startswith`, or `endswith`.

For example, the first of these queries will run faster:

```kusto
EventLog | where continent has "North" | count;
EventLog | where continent contains "nor" | count
```
