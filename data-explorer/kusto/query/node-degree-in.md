# node_degree_in() (graph function)

> [!INCLUDE [applies](../includes/applies-to-version/applies.md)] [!INCLUDE [fabric](../includes/applies-to-version/fabric.md)] [!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer](../includes/applies-to-version/azure-data-explorer.md)]

The `node_degree_in` function calculates the *in-degree*, or number of incoming edges, to a node in a directed graph.

> [!NOTE]
> This function is used with the [`graph-match`](graph-match-operator.md) and [`graph-shortest-paths`](graph-shortest-paths-operator.md) operators.

## Syntax

`node_degree_in([`*node*`])`

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| *node* | `string` |  | The reference to a graph node variable in a graph pattern. <br>Don't pass any parameters when used inside [all()](all-graph-function.md), [any()](any-graph-function.md), and [map()](map-graph-function.md) graph functions, with [inner_nodes()](inner-nodes-graph-function.md).|

## Returns

Returns the in-degree of the input node or of all inner nodes, when used inside [all()](all-graph-function.md), [any()](any-graph-function.md), and [map()](map-graph-function.md) functions with [inner_nodes()](inner-nodes-graph-function.md).

## Example

The following example creates a graph to analyze a hierarchical structure of employees and their managers. 

The graph-match operator looks for managers who have exactly three direct reports (node_degree_in(manager) == 3) and where any of the inner nodes (employees) have at least one report (node_degree_in() > 1).

The query returns the manager, the name of each direct report, the in-degree to the manager, and the number of direct reports for each employee.

            degree_in_m=node_degree_in(manager), 
            degree_out_e=node_degree_out(employee) 
```

**Output**

| manager_name | employee_name | reports_and_inner_nodes_degree_in | degree_in_m | degree_out_e |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Alice | Richard | ["Bob has 2 reports"] | 3 | 1 |
| Alice | Eve | ["Bob has 2 reports"] | 3 | 1 |
| Alice | Ellen | [<br>"Bob has 2 reports", <br>"Eve has 1 reports"<br>] | 3 | 1 |
