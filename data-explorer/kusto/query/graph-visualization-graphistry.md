# Graph visualization with Graphistry

> [!INCLUDE [applies](../includes/applies-to-version/applies.md)] [!INCLUDE [fabric](../includes/applies-to-version/fabric.md)] [!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer](../includes/applies-to-version/azure-data-explorer.md)]

Graphistry adds server-side GPU layout and filtering on top of KQL graph semantics for iterative exploration of large or dense connected data: heavy parallel layout/clustering runs on a managed GPU, only light render data streams to the browser for consistent responsiveness across devices, enabling rapid refineâ€“explore cycles on focused KQL results while preserving governance (deploy in your subscription, limit exported attributes, keep stable identifiers, filter early, iterate as needed, and share live views without producing static exports).

Deploy Graphistry Core in your Azure subscription (Azure Marketplace) so GPU processing stays in-boundary. See the [integration blog](https://www.graphistry.com/blog/azure-data-explorer-kusto-graph-visual-exploration) and the concise [demo notebook](https://pygraphistry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/demos/demos_databases_apis/microsoft/kusto/graphistry_ADX_kusto_demo.html) for a hands-on sample.
