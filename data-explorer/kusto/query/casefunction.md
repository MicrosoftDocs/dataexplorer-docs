# case()

Evaluates a list of predicates and returns the first result expression whose predicate is satisfied.

If neither of the predicates return `true`, the result of the last expression (the `else`) is returned.
All odd arguments (count starts at 1) must be expressions that evaluate to a  `boolean` value.
All even arguments (the `then`s) and the last argument (the `else`) must be of the same type.

## Syntax

`case(`*predicate_1*`,` *then_1*,
       *predicate_2*`,` *then_2*,
       *predicate_3*`,` *then_3*,
       *else*`)`

## Arguments

* *predicate_i*: An expression that evaluates to a `boolean` value.
* *then_i*: An expression that gets evaluated and its value is returned from the function if *predicate_i* is the first predicate that evaluates to `true`.
* *else*: An expression that gets evaluated and its value is returned from the function if neither of the *predicate_i* evaluate to `true`.

## Returns

The value of the first *then_i* whose *predicate_i* evaluates to `true`, or the value of *else* if neither of the predicates are satisfied.

## Example

```kusto
range Size from 1 to 15 step 2
| extend bucket = case(Size <= 3, "Small", 
                       Size <= 10, "Medium", 
                       "Large")
```

|Size|bucket|
|---|---|
|1|Small|
|3|Small|
|5|Medium|
|7|Medium|
|9|Medium|
|11|Large|
|13|Large|
|15|Large|
