# count() (aggregation function)

Counts the number of records per summarization group, or total if summarization is done without grouping.

[!INCLUDE [ignore-nulls](../../includes/ignore-nulls.md)]

To only count records for which a predicate returns `true`, use [countif()](countif-aggregation-function.md).

[!INCLUDE [data-explorer-agg-function-summarize-note](../../includes/data-explorer-agg-function-summarize-note.md)]

## Syntax

`count()`

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

## Returns

Returns a count of the records per summarization group, or in total if summarization is done without grouping.

## Example
