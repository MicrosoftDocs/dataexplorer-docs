# Python plugin

::: zone pivot="azuredataexplorer"

The Python plugin runs a user-defined-function (UDF) using a Python script. The Python script gets tabular data as its input, and is expected to produce a tabular output.
The plugin's runtime is hosted in [sandboxes](../concepts/sandboxes.md), running on the cluster's nodes.

## Syntax

*T* `|` `evaluate` [`hint.distribution` `=` (`single` | `per_node`)] `python(`*output_schema*`,` *script* [`,` *script_parameters*][`,` *external_artifacts*]`)`

## Arguments

* *output_schema*: A `type` literal that defines the output schema of the tabular data, returned by the Python code.
    * The format is: `typeof(`*ColumnName*`:` *ColumnType*[, ...]`)`. For example, `typeof(col1:string, col2:long)`.
    * To extend the input schema, use the following syntax: `typeof(*, col1:string, col2:long)`
* *script*: A `string` literal that is the valid Python script to execute.
* *script_parameters*: An optional `dynamic` literal. It's a property bag of name/value pairs to be passed to the
   Python script as the reserved `kargs` dictionary. For more information, see [Reserved Python variables](#reserved-python-variables).
* *hint.distribution*: An optional hint for the plugin's execution to be distributed across multiple cluster nodes.
  * The default value is `single`.
  * `single`: A single instance of the script will run over the entire query data.
  * `per_node`: If the query before the Python block is distributed, an instance of the script will run on each node, on the data that it contains.
* *external_artifacts*: An optional `dynamic` literal that is a property bag of name and URL pairs, for artifacts that are accessible from cloud storage. They can be made available for the script to use at runtime.
  * URLs referenced in this property bag are required to be:
    * Included in the cluster's [callout policy](../management/calloutpolicy.md).
    * In a publicly available location, or provide the necessary credentials, as explained in [storage connection strings](../api/connection-strings/storage.md).
  * The artifacts are made available for the script to consume from a local temporary directory, `.\Temp`. The names provided in the property bag are used as the local file names. See [Examples](#examples).
  * For more information, see [Install packages for the Python plugin](#install-packages-for-the-python-plugin). 

## Reserved Python variables

The following variables are reserved for interaction between Kusto query language and the Python code.

* `df`: The input tabular data (the values of `T` above), as a `pandas` DataFrame.
* `kargs`: The value of the *script_parameters* argument, as a Python dictionary.
* `result`: A `pandas` DataFrame created by the Python script, whose value becomes the tabular data that gets sent to the Kusto query operator that follows the plugin.

## Enable the plugin

* The plugin is disabled by default.
* To enable the plugin, see the list of [prerequisites](../concepts/sandboxes.md#prerequisites).
* Enable or disable the plugin in the Azure portal, in your cluster's [Configuration tab](../../language-extensions.md).

## Python sandbox image

* The Python sandbox image is based on *Anaconda 5.2.0* distribution with the *Python 3.6* engine.
  See the list of [Anaconda packages](http://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/old-pkg-lists/5.2.0/py3.6_win-64/).
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > A small percentage of packages might be incompatible with the limitations enforced by the sandbox where the plugin is run.
  
* The Python image also contains common ML packages: `tensorflow`, `keras`, `torch`, `hdbscan`, `xgboost`, and other useful packages.
* The plugin imports *numpy* (as `np`) & *pandas* (as `pd`) by default.  You can import other modules as needed.

## Use Ingestion from query and update policy

* Use the plugin in queries that are:
  * Defined as part of an [update policy](../management/updatepolicy.md), whose source table is ingested to using *non-streaming* ingestion.
  * Run as part of a command that [ingests from a query](../management/data-ingestion/ingest-from-query.md), such as `.set-or-append`.
    In both these cases, verify that the volume and frequency of the ingestion, and the complexity and
    resources used by the Python logic, align with [sandbox limitations](../concepts/sandboxes.md#limitations) and the cluster's available resources. Failure to do so may result in [throttling errors](../concepts/sandboxes.md#errors).
* You can't use the plugin in a query that is defined as part of an update policy, whose source table is ingested using [streaming ingestion](../../ingest-data-streaming.md).

## Examples

```kusto
range x from 1 to 360 step 1
| evaluate python(
//
typeof(*, fx:double),               //  Output schema: append a new fx column to original table 
//
'result = df\n'                     //  The Python decorated script
'n = df.shape[0]\n'
'g = kargs["gain"]\n'
'f = kargs["cycles"]\n'
'result["fx"] = g * np.sin(df["x"]/n*2*np.pi*f)\n'
//
, pack('gain', 100, 'cycles', 4)    //  dictionary of parameters
)
| render linechart 
```

                 "this_is_a_script":"https://kustoscriptsamples.blob.core.windows.net/samples/python/sample_script.py"})
)
```

| File                  | Size |
|-----------------------|------|
| this_is_a_script      | 120  |
| this_is_my_first_file | 105  |

## Performance tips

* Reduce the plugin's input data set to the minimum amount required (columns/rows).
    * Use filters on the source data set, when possible, with Kusto's query language.
    * To do a calculation on a subset of the source columns, project only those columns before invoking the plugin.
* Use `hint.distribution = per_node` whenever the logic in your script is distributable.
    * You can also use the [partition operator](partitionoperator.md) for partitioning the input data set.
* Use Kusto's query language whenever possible, to implement the logic of your Python script.

    ## Example

    ```kusto    
    .show operations
    | where StartedOn > ago(7d) // Filtering out irrelevant records before invoking the plugin
    | project d_seconds = Duration / 1s // Projecting only a subset of the necessary columns
    | evaluate hint.distribution = per_node python( // Using per_node distribution, as the script's logic allows it
        typeof(*, _2d:double),
        'result = df\n'
        'result["_2d"] = 2 * df["d_seconds"]\n' // Negative example: this logic should have been written using Kusto's query language
      )
    | summarize avg = avg(_2d)
    ```

## Usage tips

* To generate multi-line strings containing the Python script in `Kusto.Explorer`, copy your Python script from your favorite
  Python editor (*Jupyter*, *Visual Studio Code*, *PyCharm*, and so on). 
  Now do one of:
    * Press **F2** to open the *Edit in Python* window. Paste the script into this window. Select **OK**. The script will be
      decorated with quotes and new lines, so it's valid in Kusto, and automatically pasted into the query tab.
    * Paste the Python code directly into the query tab. Select those lines, and press **Ctrl+K**, **Ctrl+S** hot keys, to decorate them as
      above. To reverse, press **Ctrl+K**, **Ctrl+M** hot keys. See the full list of [Query Editor shortcuts](../tools/kusto-explorer-shortcuts.md#query-editor).
* To avoid conflicts between Kusto string delimiters and Python string literals, use:
     * Single quote characters (`'`) for Kusto string literals in Kusto queries
     * Double quote characters (`"`) for Python string literals in Python scripts
* Use the [`externaldata` operator](externaldata-operator.md) to obtain the content of a script that you've stored in an external location, such as Azure Blob storage.
  
    ## Example

    ```kusto
    let script = 
        externaldata(script:string)
        [h'https://kustoscriptsamples.blob.core.windows.net/samples/python/sample_script.py']
        with(format = raw);
    range x from 1 to 360 step 1
    | evaluate python(
        typeof(*, fx:double),
        toscalar(script), 
        pack('gain', 100, 'cycles', 4))
    | render linechart 
    ```

## Install packages for the Python plugin

You may need to install package(s) yourself, for the following reasons:

* The package is private and is your own.
* The package is public but isn't included in the plugin's base image.

Install packages as follows:

### Prerequisites

  1. Create a blob container to host the packages, preferably in the same place as your cluster. For example, `https://artifcatswestus.blob.core.windows.net/python`, assuming your cluster is in West US.
  1. Alter the cluster's [callout policy](../management/calloutpolicy.md) to allow access to that location.
        * This change requires [AllDatabasesAdmin](../management/access-control/role-based-authorization.md) permissions.

        * For example, to enable access to a blob located in `https://artifcatswestus.blob.core.windows.net/python`, run the following command:

        ```kusto
        .alter-merge cluster policy callout @'[ { "CalloutType": "sandbox_artifacts", "CalloutUriRegex": "artifcatswestus\\.blob\\.core\\.windows\\.net/python/","CanCall": true } ]'
        ```

### Install packages

1. For public packages in [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) or other channels,
download the package and its dependencies.

   * Compile wheel (`*.whl`) files, if required.
   * From a cmd window in your local Python environment, run:
    
    ```python
    pip wheel [-w download-dir] package-name.
    ```

1. Create a zip file, that contains the required package and its dependencies.

    * For private packages: zip the folder of the package and the folders of its dependencies.
    * For public packages, zip the files that were downloaded in the previous step.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > * Make sure to zip the `.whl` files themselves, and not their parent folder.
    > * You can skip `.whl` files for packages that already exist with the same version in the base sandbox image.

1. Upload the zipped file to a blob in the artifacts location (from step 1).

1. Call the `python` plugin.
    * Specify the `external_artifacts` parameter with a property bag of name and reference to the zip file (the blob's URL).
    * In your inline python code, import `Zipackage` from `sandbox_utils` and call its `install()` method with the name of the zip file.

### Example

Install the [Faker](https://pypi.org/project/Faker/) package that generates fake data.

```kusto
range ID from 1 to 3 step 1 
| extend Name=''
| evaluate python(typeof(*),
    'from sandbox_utils import Zipackage\n'
    'Zipackage.install("Faker.zip")\n'
    'from faker import Faker\n'
    'fake = Faker()\n'
    'result = df\n'
    'for i in range(df.shape[0]):\n'
    '    result.loc[i, "Name"] = fake.name()\n',
    external_artifacts=pack('faker.zip', 'https://artifacts.blob.core.windows.net/kusto/Faker.zip?...'))
```
