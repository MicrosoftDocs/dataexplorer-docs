# active_users_count plugin

Calculates distinct count of values, where each value has appeared in at least a minimum number of periods in a lookback period.

Useful for calculating distinct counts of "fans" only,  while not including appearances of "non-fans". A user is counted as a "fan" only if it was active during the lookback period. 
The lookback period is only used to determine whether a user is considered `active` ("fan") or not. 
The aggregation itself doesn't include users from the lookback window. In comparison, the [sliding_window_counts](sliding-window-counts-plugin.md) aggregation is performed over a sliding window of the lookback period.

```kusto
T | evaluate active_users_count(id, datetime_column, startofday(ago(30d)), startofday(now()), 7d, 1d, 2, 7d, dim1, dim2, dim3)
```

## Syntax

*T* `| evaluate` `active_users_count(`*IdColumn*`,` *TimelineColumn*`,` *Start*`,` *End*`,` *LookbackWindow*`,` *Period*`,` *ActivePeriodsCount*`,` *Bin* `,` [*dim1*`,` *dim2*`,` ...]`)`

## Arguments

* *T*: The input tabular expression.
* *IdColumn*: The name of the column with ID values that represent user activity. 
* *TimelineColumn*: The name of the column that represents timeline.
* *Start*: (optional) Scalar with value of the analysis start period.
* *End*: (optional) Scalar with value of the analysis end period.
* *LookbackWindow*: A sliding time window defining a period where user appearance is checked. Lookback period starts at ([current appearance] - [lookback window]) and ends on ([current appearance]). 
* *Period*: Scalar constant timespan to count as single appearance (a user will be counted as active if it appears in at least distinct ActivePeriodsCount of this timespan.
* *ActivePeriodsCount*: Minimal number of distinct active periods to decide if user is active. Active users are those users who appeared in at least (equal or greater than) active periods count.
* *Bin*: Scalar constant value of the analysis step period. Can be a numeric/datetime/timestamp value, or a string that is `week`/`month`/`year`. All periods will be the corresponding [startofweek](startofweekfunction.md)/[startofmonth](startofmonthfunction.md)/[startofyear](startofyearfunction.md) functions.
* *dim1*, *dim2*, ...: (optional) list of the dimensions columns that slice the activity metrics calculation.

## Returns

Returns a table that has distinct count values for IDs that have appeared in ActivePeriodCounts in the following periods: the lookback period, each timeline period, and each existing dimensions combination.

Output table schema is:

|*TimelineColumn*|dim1|..|dim_n|dcount_values|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|type: as of *TimelineColumn*|..|..|..|long|


## Examples

Calculate weekly number of distinct users that appeared in at least three different days over a period of prior eight days. Period of analysis: July 2018.

```kusto
let Start = datetime(2018-07-01);
let End = datetime(2018-07-31);
let LookbackWindow = 8d;
let Period = 1d;
let ActivePeriods = 3;
let Bin = 7d; 
let T =  datatable(User:string, Timestamp:datetime)
[
    "B",      datetime(2018-06-29),
    "B",      datetime(2018-06-30),
    "A",      datetime(2018-07-02),
    "B",      datetime(2018-07-04),
    "B",      datetime(2018-07-08),
    "A",      datetime(2018-07-10),
    "A",      datetime(2018-07-14),
    "A",      datetime(2018-07-17),
    "A",      datetime(2018-07-20),
    "B",      datetime(2018-07-24)
]; 
T | evaluate active_users_count(User, Timestamp, Start, End, LookbackWindow, Period, ActivePeriods, Bin)



```

|Timestamp|`dcount`|
|---|---|
|2018-07-01 00:00:00.0000000|1|
|2018-07-15 00:00:00.0000000|1|

A user is considered active if it fulfills both of the following criteria: 
* The user was seen in at least three distinct days (Period = 1d, ActivePeriods=3).
* The user was seen in a lookback window of 8d before and including their current appearance.

In the illustration below, the only appearances that are active by this criteria are the following instances: User A on 7/20 and User B on 7/4 (see plugin results above). 
The appearances of User B are included for the lookback window on 7/4, but not for the Start-End time range of 6/29-30.
