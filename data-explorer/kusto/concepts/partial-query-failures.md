# Partial query failures

A *partial query failure* is a failure to run the query that gets detected
only after the query has started the actual execution phase. By that time,
Kusto has already returned the HTTP status line `200 OK` back to the client,
and can't "take it back," so it has to indicate the failure in the result
stream that carries the query results back to the client. (In fact, it may have
already returned some result data back to the caller.)

There are several kinds of partial query failures:
* [Runaway queries](runawayqueries.md): Queries that take up too many
  resources.
* [Result truncation](resulttruncation.md): Queries whose result set
  has been truncated as it exceeded some limit.
* [Overflows](overflow.md): Queries that trigger an overflow error.
* Other runtime errors: For example, network errors when invoking a
  cross-cluster query, or errors received from a plugin, etc.

Partial query failures can be reported back to the client in one of two
ways:

* By default, a JSON property bag holding the failure information appears as
  part of the result data, where a JSON array is normally expected.
* As part of the "QueryStatus" table in the result stream. To prevent failure information
  from appearing as part of the result data, set the `deferpartialqueryfailures` option in the request's
  `properties` slot (`Kusto.Data.Common.ClientRequestProperties.OptionDeferPartialQueryFailures`).
  Clients that do that take on the responsibility to consume the entire
  result stream from the service, locate the `QueryStatus` result, and
  make sure no record in this result has a `Severity` of `2` or smaller.

> [!WARNING]
> To expedite delivery of a partial query failure, Kusto may in some cases
> "flush" the result stream, yielding incorrect results. As a result, the consumer should
> ignore the entire result if observing a partial query failure.
