Use this command to delete the database cache policy. To speed up queries, data is cached on processing nodes, SSD, or even in RAM. The [cache policy](cache-policy.md) allows your cluster to describe the data artifacts that it uses, so that more important data can take priority.

You must have at least [Database Admin](access-control/role-based-access-control.md) permissions to run this command.

## Syntax

`.delete` `database` *DatabaseName* `policy` `caching`

|*DatabaseName*| `string` | :heavy_check_mark:|The name of the database.|

## Example
