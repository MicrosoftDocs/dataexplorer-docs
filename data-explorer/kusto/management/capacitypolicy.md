# Capacity policy

A capacity policy is used for controlling the compute resources of data management operations on the cluster.

## The capacity policy object

The capacity policy is made of:

* [IngestionCapacity](#ingestion-capacity)
* [ExtentsMergeCapacity](#extents-merge-capacity)
* [ExtentsPurgeRebuildCapacity](#extents-purge-rebuild-capacity)
* [ExportCapacity](#export-capacity)
* [ExtentsPartitionCapacity](#extents-partition-capacity)
* [MaterializedViewsCapacity](#materialized-views-capacity-policy)
* [StoredQueryResultsCapacity](#stored-query-results-capacity)

## Ingestion capacity

|Property       |Type    |Description    |
|-----------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations |long    |A maximal value for the number of concurrent ingestion operations in a cluster.               |
|CoreUtilizationCoefficient         |double  |A coefficient for the percentage of cores to use when calculating the ingestion capacity. The calculation's result will always be normalized by `ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations` <br> The cluster's total ingestion capacity, as shown by [.show capacity](../management/diagnostics.md#show-capacity), is calculated by: <br> Minimum(`ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations`, `Number of nodes in cluster` * Maximum(1, `Core count per node` * `CoreUtilizationCoefficient`))

> [!NOTE]
> In clusters with four or more nodes, the admin node doesn't participate in ingestion operations. The `Number of nodes in cluster` is reduced by one.

## Extents merge capacity

|Property                           |Type    |Description                                                                                                |
|-----------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|MinimumConcurrentOperationsPerNode |long    |A minimal value for the number of concurrent extents merge/rebuild operations on a single node. Default is 1 |
|MaximumConcurrentOperationsPerNode |long    |A maximal value for the number of concurrent extents merge/rebuild operations on a single node. Default is 5 |

The cluster's total extents merge capacity, as shown by [`.show capacity`](../management/diagnostics.md#show-capacity), is calculated by:

`Number of nodes in cluster` x `Concurrent operations per node`

The effective value for `Concurrent operations per node` gets automatically adjusted by the system in the range [`MinimumConcurrentOperationsPerNode`,`MaximumConcurrentOperationsPerNode`], as long as the success rate of the
merge operations is 90% or higher.

> [!NOTE]
> In clusters with three or more nodes, the admin node doesn't participate in doing merge operations. The `Number of nodes in cluster` is reduced by one.

## Extents purge rebuild capacity

|Property                           |Type    |Description                                                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|MaximumConcurrentOperationsPerNode |long    |A maximal value for the number of concurrent rebuild extents for purge operations on a single node |

The cluster's total extents purge rebuild capacity (as shown by [`.show capacity`](../management/diagnostics.md#show-capacity)) is calculated by:

`Number of nodes in cluster` x `MaximumConcurrentOperationsPerNode`

> [!NOTE]
> In clusters with three or more nodes, the admin node doesn't participate in doing merge operations. The `Number of nodes in cluster` is reduced by one.

## Export capacity

|Property                           |Type    |Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations |long    |A maximal value for the number of concurrent export operations in a cluster.                                           |
|CoreUtilizationCoefficient         |double  |A coefficient for the percentage of cores to use when calculating the export capacity. The calculation's result will always be normalized by `ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations`. |

The cluster's total export capacity, as shown by [`.show capacity`](../management/diagnostics.md#show-capacity), is calculated by:

Minimum(`ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations`, `Number of nodes in cluster` * Maximum(1, `Core count per node` * `CoreUtilizationCoefficient`))

> [!NOTE]
> In clusters with three or more nodes, the admin node doesn't participate in export operations. The `Number of nodes in cluster` is reduced by one.

## Extents partition capacity

|Property                           |Type    |Description                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|ClusterMinimumConcurrentOperations |long    |A minimal value for the number of concurrent extents partition operations in a cluster. Default: 1  |
|ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations |long    |A maximal value for the number of concurrent extents partition operations in a cluster. Default: 32 |

The cluster's total extents partition capacity (as shown by [`.show capacity`](../management/diagnostics.md#show-capacity)).

The effective value for `Concurrent operations` is automatically adjusted by the system in the range
[`ClusterMinimumConcurrentOperations`,`ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations`], as long as the success rate of the
partitioning operations is 90% or higher.

## Materialized views capacity policy

The policy can be used to change concurrency settings for [materialized views](materialized-views/materialized-view-overview.md). Changing the materialized views capacity policy may be useful when there's more than a single materialized view defined on a cluster.

|Property                           |Type    |Description                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|ClusterMinimumConcurrentOperations |long    |A minimal value for the number of concurrent materialization operations in a cluster. Default: 1  |
|ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations |long    |A maximal value for the number of concurrent materialization operations in a cluster. Default: 10 |

The effective value for `concurrent operations` is automatically adjusted by the system in the range
[`ClusterMinimumConcurrentOperations`,`ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations`], based on the number of materialized views in the cluster and the cluster's CPU.
Use [`.show capacity`](../management/diagnostics.md#show-capacity) materialized-view to show the effective value of `concurrent operations`.

> [!WARNING]
> The `ClusterMinimumConcurrentOperations` should only be increased if the cluster's resources are well (low CPU, available memory). Increasing these values when resources are limited may result in resources exhaustion and will badly impact the cluster's performance.

### Extents rebuild capacity

For more information about extents rebuild operations, see [how materialized views work](materialized-views/materialized-view-overview.md#how-materialized-views-work).
This setting is only relevant to Engine V2 clusters. This setting isn't relevant to [EngineV3](../../engine-v3.md) clusters.

The maximum number of extents rebuild is calculated by:
  
```kusto
Maximum(`ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations`, `Number of nodes in cluster` * `MaximumConcurrentOperationsPerNode`)
```

* Default values are 50 total concurrency rebuilds and maximum 5 per node.
* The `ExtentsRebuildCapacity` policy serves as an upper limit only. The actual value used is dynamically determined by the system, based on current cluster's conditions (memory, CPU) and an estimation of the amount of resources required by the rebuild operation. In practice, concurrency can be much lower than the value specified in capacity policy.
* The `MaterializedViewExtentsRebuild` metric provides information about how many extents were rebuilt in each materialization cycle. For more information, see [materialized views monitoring](materialized-views/materialized-views-monitoring.md).

## Stored query results capacity

|Property       |Type    |Description    |
|-----------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|MaximumConcurrentOperationsPerDbAdmin |long    | The maximum number of concurrent ingestion operations in a cluster admin node.               |
|CoreUtilizationCoefficient         |double  |A coefficient for the percentage of cores to use when calculating the stored query results creation capacity. |

The cluster's total stored query results creation capacity, as shown by [`.show capacity`](../management/diagnostics.md#show-capacity), is calculated by:

`Number of nodes in cluster` * Maximum(1, `Core count per node` * `CoreUtilizationCoefficient`)

## Defaults

The default capacity policy has the following JSON representation:

```json
{
  "IngestionCapacity": {
    "ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations": 512,
    "CoreUtilizationCoefficient": 0.75
  },
  "ExtentsMergeCapacity": {
    "MinimumConcurrentOperationsPerNode": 1,
    "MaximumConcurrentOperationsPerNode": 3
  },
  "ExtentsPurgeRebuildCapacity": {
    "MaximumConcurrentOperationsPerNode": 1
  },
  "ExportCapacity": {
    "ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations": 100,
    "CoreUtilizationCoefficient": 0.25
  },
  "ExtentsPartitionCapacity": {
    "ClusterMinimumConcurrentOperations": 1,
    "ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations": 32
  },
  "MaterializedViewsCapacity": {
    "ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations": 1,
    "ExtentsRebuildCapacity": {
      "ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations": 50,
      "MaximumConcurrentOperationsPerNode": 5
    }
  },
  "StoredQueryResultsCapacity": {
    "MaximumConcurrentOperationsPerDbAdmin": 250,
    "CoreUtilizationCoefficient": 0.75
  }
}
```

## Management commands

> [!WARNING]
> Consult with the support team before altering a capacity policy.

* Use [`.show cluster policy capacity`](./show-cluster-capacity-policy-command.md) to show the current capacity policy of the cluster.

* Use [`.alter cluster policy capacity`](./alter-capacity-policy-command.md) to alter the capacity policy of the cluster.

## Management commands throttling

Kusto limits the number of concurrent requests for the following user-initiated commands:

* **Ingestions**
  * This category includes commands that [ingest from storage](data-ingestion/ingest-from-storage.md), [ingest from a query](data-ingestion/ingest-from-query.md), and [ingest inline](data-ingestion/ingest-inline.md).
  * The limit is as defined by the [ingestion capacity](#ingestion-capacity).
* **Purges**
  * The global limit is currently fixed at one per cluster.
  * The [purge rebuild capacity](#extents-purge-rebuild-capacity) is used internally to determine the number of concurrent rebuild operations during purge commands. Purge commands won't be blocked or throttled because of this process, but will complete faster or slower depending on the purge rebuild capacity.
* **Exports**
  * The limit is as defined in the [export capacity](#export-capacity).

When the cluster detects that an operation has exceeded the limit on concurrent requests:

* The command's state, as presented by [System information commands](systeminfo.md), will be `Throttled`.
* The error message will include the *command type*, the *origin* of the throttling and the *capacity* that's been exceeded. For example:
  * For example: `The management command was aborted due to throttling. Retrying after some backoff might succeed. CommandType: 'TableSetOrAppend', Capacity: 18, Origin: 'CapacityPolicy/Ingestion'`.
* The HTTP response code will be `429`. The subcode will be `TooManyRequests`.
* The exception type will be `ControlCommandThrottledException`.

> [!NOTE]
> Management commands may also be throttled as a result of exceeding the limit defined by a workload group's [Request rate limit policy](request-rate-limit-policy.md).
