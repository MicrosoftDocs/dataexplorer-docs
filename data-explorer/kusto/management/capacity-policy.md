# Capacity policy

> [!INCLUDE [applies](../includes/applies-to-version/applies.md)] [!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer](../includes/applies-to-version/azure-data-explorer.md)]

A capacity policy is used for controlling the compute resources of data management operations on the cluster.

## The capacity policy object

The capacity policy is made of the following components:

* [IngestionCapacity](#ingestion-capacity)
* [ExtentsMergeCapacity](#extents-merge-capacity)
* [ExtentsPurgeRebuildCapacity](#extents-purge-rebuild-capacity)
* [ExportCapacity](#export-capacity)
* [ExtentsPartitionCapacity](#extents-partition-capacity)
* [MaterializedViewsCapacity](#materialized-views-capacity-policy)
* [StoredQueryResultsCapacity](#stored-query-results-capacity)
* [StreamingIngestionPostProcessingCapacity](#streaming-ingestion-post-processing-capacity)
* [PurgeStorageArtifactsCleanupCapacity](#purge-storage-artifacts-cleanup-capacity)
* [PeriodicStorageArtifactsCleanupCapacity](#periodic-storage-artifacts-cleanup-capacity)
* [QueryAccelerationCapacity](#query-acceleration-capacity)
* [GraphSnapshotsCapacity](#graph-snapshots-capacity)

To view the capacity of your cluster, use the [.show capacity](show-capacity-command.md) command.

### Ingestion capacity

| Property | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations` | `long` | The maximum number of concurrent ingestion operations allowed in a cluster. This value caps the total ingestion capacity, as shown in the following formula. |
| `CoreUtilizationCoefficient` | `real` | Determines the percentage of cores to use in the ingestion capacity calculation.|

**Formula**

The [.show capacity](show-capacity-command.md) command returns the cluster's ingestion capacity based on the following formula:

`Minimum(ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations` `,` *Number of nodes in cluster* `*` `Maximum(1,` *Core count per node* `*`  `CoreUtilizationCoefficient))`

> [!NOTE]
> In clusters with four or more nodes, the admin node doesn't participate in ingestion operations, so the *Number of nodes in cluster* is reduced by one.

### Extents merge capacity

| Property | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `MinimumConcurrentOperationsPerNode` | `long` | The minimal number of concurrent extents merge/rebuild operations on a single node. Default is `1`. |
| `MaximumConcurrentOperationsPerNode` |`long` | The maximum number of concurrent extents merge/rebuild operations on a single node. Default is `5`. |
| `ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations`  | `long` | The maximum number of concurrent extents merge/rebuild operations allowed in a cluster. This value caps the total merge capacity. |

**Formula**

The [.show capacity](show-capacity-command.md) command returns the cluster's extents merge capacity based on the following formula:

`Minimum(`*Number of nodes in cluster* `*` *Concurrent operations per node*`,` `ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations)`

The effective value for *Concurrent operations per node* is automatically adjusted by the system in the range [`MinimumConcurrentOperationsPerNode`,`MaximumConcurrentOperationsPerNode`], as long as the success rate of the merge operations is 90% or higher.

> [!NOTE]
> In clusters with four or more nodes, the admin node doesn't participate in merge operations, so *Number of nodes in cluster* is reduced by one.

> [!WARNING]
> Due to the complexity of the extents merge policy, we recommend that you [consult with support](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Support) before making any changes.

### Extents purge rebuild capacity

| Property | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `MaximumConcurrentOperationsPerNode` | `long` | The maximum number of concurrent rebuild extents for purge operations on a single node. |

**Formula**

The [.show capacity](show-capacity-command.md) command returns the cluster's extents purge rebuild capacity based on the following formula:

*Number of nodes in cluster* x `MaximumConcurrentOperationsPerNode`

> [!NOTE]
> In clusters with four or more nodes, the admin node doesn't participate in purge operations, so *Number of nodes in cluster* is reduced by one.

### Export capacity

| Property | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations` | `long` | The maximum number of concurrent export operations in a cluster. This value caps the total export capacity, as shown in the following formula. |
| `CoreUtilizationCoefficient` | `long` | Determines the percentage of cores to use in the export capacity calculation. |

**Formula**

The [.show capacity](show-capacity-command.md) command returns the cluster's export capacity based on the following formula:

`Minimum(ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations` `,` *Number of nodes in cluster* `*` `Maximum(1,` *Core count per node* `*`  `CoreUtilizationCoefficient))`

> [!NOTE]
> In clusters with four or more nodes, the admin node doesn't participate in export operations. The `Number of nodes in cluster` is reduced by one.

### Extents partition capacity

| Property | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `ClusterMinimumConcurrentOperations` | `long` | The minimal number of concurrent extents partition operations in a cluster. Default is `1`. |
| `ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations` | `long` | The maximum number of concurrent extents partition operations in a cluster. Default is `32`. |

The effective value for *Concurrent operations* is automatically adjusted by the system in the range
[`ClusterMinimumConcurrentOperations`,`ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations`], as long as the success rate of the
partitioning operations is 90% or higher.

### Materialized views capacity policy

The policy can be used to change concurrency settings for [materialized views](materialized-views/materialized-view-overview.md). Changing the materialized views capacity policy can be useful when there's more than a single materialized view defined on a cluster.

| Property | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `ClusterMinimumConcurrentOperations` | `long` | The minimal number of concurrent materialization operations in a cluster. Default is `1`. |
| `ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations` | `long` | The maximum number of concurrent materialization operations in a cluster. Default is `10`. |

By default, only a single materialization runs concurrently (see [how materialized views work](materialized-views/materialized-view-overview.md#how-materialized-views-work)). The system adjusts the current concurrency in the range [`ClusterMinimumConcurrentOperations`,`ClusterMaximumConcurrentOperations`], based on the number of materialized views in the cluster and the cluster's CPU. You can increase/decrease concurrency by altering this policy. For example, if the cluster has 10 materialized views, setting the `ClusterMinimumConcurrentOperations` to five ensures that at least five of them can materialize concurrently.
You can view the effective value for the current concurrency using the [.show capacity command](show-capacity-command.md)

> [!WARNING]
> Raising the `ClusterMinimumConcurrentOperations` can lead to resource exhaustion and degrade cluster performance. Carefully monitor the cluster's health and increase concurrency gradually if you manually alter this policy.

### Stored query results capacity

| Property | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `MaximumConcurrentOperationsPerDbAdmin` | `long` | The maximum number of concurrent ingestion operations in a cluster admin node. |
| `CoreUtilizationCoefficient` | `real` | Determines the percentage of cores to use in the stored query results creation calculation. |

**Formula**

The [.show capacity](show-capacity-command.md) command returns the cluster's stored query results creation capacity based on the following formula:

`Minimum(MaximumConcurrentOperationsPerDbAdmin` `,` *Number of nodes in cluster* `*` `Maximum(1,` *Core count per node* `*` `CoreUtilizationCoefficient))`

> [!NOTE]
> In clusters with four or more nodes, the admin node doesn't participate in stored query results creation operations, so the *Number of nodes in cluster* is reduced by one.

### Streaming ingestion post processing capacity

| Property | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `MaximumConcurrentOperationsPerNode` | `long` | The maximum number of concurrent streaming ingestion post processing operations on each cluster node. |

**Formula**

The [.show capacity](show-capacity-command.md) command returns the cluster's streaming ingestion post processing capacity based on the following formula:

*Number of nodes in cluster* x `MaximumConcurrentOperationsPerNode`

> [!NOTE]
> In clusters with four or more nodes, the admin node doesn't participate in streaming ingestion post processing, so *Number of nodes in cluster* is reduced by one.

## Management commands

> [!WARNING]
> Given the complexity of the capacity policy, we recommend that you [consult with support](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Support) before making any changes.

* Use [`.show cluster policy capacity`](show-cluster-capacity-policy-command.md) to show the current capacity policy of the cluster.
* Use [`.alter-merge cluster policy capacity`](alter-merge-capacity-policy-command.md) to alter the capacity policy of the cluster.

## Management commands throttling

Kusto limits the number of concurrent requests for the following user-initiated commands:

* **Ingestions**
  * This category includes commands that [ingest from storage](data-ingestion/ingest-into-command.md), [ingest from a query](data-ingestion/ingest-from-query.md), and [ingest inline](data-ingestion/ingest-inline.md).
  * The [ingestion capacity](#ingestion-capacity) defines the limit.
* **Purges**
  * The global limit is currently fixed at one per cluster.
  * The [purge rebuild capacity](#extents-purge-rebuild-capacity) is used internally to determine the number of concurrent rebuild operations during purge commands. Purge commands aren't blocked or throttled because of this process, but completes faster or slower depending on the purge rebuild capacity.
* **Exports**
  * The limit is as defined in the [export capacity](#export-capacity).
* **Query Acceleration**
  * The limit is as defined in the [query acceleration capacity](#query-acceleration-capacity).

When the cluster detects that an operation exceeded the limit on concurrent requests:

* The command's state, as presented by [System information commands](system-info.md), is `Throttled`.
* The error message includes the *command type*, the *origin* of the throttling and the *capacity* that exceeded. For example:
  * For example: `The management command was aborted due to throttling. Retrying after some backoff might succeed. CommandType: 'TableSetOrAppend', Capacity: 18, Origin: 'CapacityPolicy/Ingestion'`.
* The HTTP response code is `429`. The subcode is `TooManyRequests`.
* The exception type is `ControlCommandThrottledException`.

> [!NOTE]
> Management commands can also be throttled if they exceed the limits set by a workload group's [Request rate limit policy](request-rate-limit-policy.md).
