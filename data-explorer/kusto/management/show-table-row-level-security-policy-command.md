# .show table row level security policy

Display a table's [row_level_security policy](rowlevelsecuritypolicy.md). The Row Level Security simplifies the design and coding of security. It lets you apply restrictions on data row access in your application. For example, limit user access to rows relevant to their department, or restrict customer access to only the data relevant to their company.

## Parameters
