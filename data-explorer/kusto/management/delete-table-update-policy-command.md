# .delete table update policy

Delete the table update policy. The [update policy](updatepolicy.md) instructs Azure Data Explorer to automatically append data to a target table whenever new data is inserted into the source table, based on a transformation query that runs on the data inserted into the source table.

> [!NOTE]
> The source table and the table for which the update policy is defined must be in the same database.
> The update policy function schema and the target table schema must match in their column names, types, and order.
