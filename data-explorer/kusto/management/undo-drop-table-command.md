# .undo drop table

The `.undo drop table` command reverts a drop table operation to a specific database version.

That database version is the one before the drop operation was executed, and corresponds to the highest minor version of one major version before the one assigned by the DROP-TABLE event written in the journal when the table was dropped. More details on how to get such version can be found in the **How to find the required database version** section below.

Requires [Database admin permission](./access-control/role-based-access-control.md).

**Syntax**

`.undo drop table` *TableName* [`as` *NewTableName*] `version=v` *DB_MajorVersion.DB_MinorVersion*

The command must be executed in the context of the database from which the table was dropped.

**Returns**

This command:
* Returns the original table extents list
* Specifies for each extent the number of records the extent contains
* Returns if the recover operation succeeded or failed
* Returns the failure reason, if relevant.

| ExtentId                             | NumberOfRecords | Status                   | FailureReason                                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ef296c9e-d75d-44bc-985c-b93dd2519691 | 100             | Recovered                |
| 370b30d7-cf2a-4997-986e-3d05f49c9689 | 1000            | Recovered                |
| 861f18a5-6cde-4f1e-a003-a43506f9e8da | 855             | Unable to recover extent | Extent container: 4b47fd84-c7db-4cfb-9378-67c1de7bf154 wasn't found, the extent was removed from storage and can't be restored |

**Examples**

```kusto
// Recover TestTable table to database version 24.3
.undo drop table TestTable version="v24.3"
```

```kusto
// Recover TestTable table to database version 10.3 with new table name, NewTestTable (can be used if a table with the same name was already created since the drop)  
.undo drop table TestTable as NewTestTable version="v10.3"
```

**How to find the required database version**

You can find the database version before the drop operation was executed by using the `.show` `journal` command :

```kusto
.show database TestDB journal | where Event == "DROP-TABLE" and EntityName == "TestTable" | project OriginalEntityVersion 
```

| OriginalEntityVersion |
|-----------------------|
| v24.3                 |

**Limitations**

If a Purge command was executed on this database, the undo drop table command can't be executed to a version earlier to the purge execution.

Extent can be recovered only if the hard delete period of the extent container it resides in wasn't reached yet.

If a table with the same name has been created and dropped several times, only most recent drop can be undone.
