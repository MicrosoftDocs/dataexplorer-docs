# Query management commands

## .show queries

The `.show` `queries` command lists queries that have reached a final state, and that the user invoking the command has access to see. Optionally, the command can return queries that are still running, queries by specific users, or queries grouped by user. To see both queries and commands completion, use [.show queries-and-commands](commands-and-queries.md).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - A [database admin or database monitor](./access-control/role-based-access-control.md) can see any command that was invoked on their database.
> - Other users can only see queries that were invoked by them.
> - When running in the context of Kusto Explorer or Azure Data Explorer, returned queries will only be shown for the _currently selected cluster_ in the **Connections** tree.

## .cancel query

The `.cancel` `query` command starts a best-effort attempt to cancel a specific running query. Cluster admins can cancel any running query. Database admins can cancel any running query that was invoked on a database to which they have admin access. All principals can cancel running queries that they started.

### Syntax

`.cancel` `query` *ClientActivityId* [`with` `(` `reason` `=` *ReasonPhrase* `)`]

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| *ClientActivityId* | string | &check; | The value of the running query's `ClientActivityId` property. Find the *ClientActivityId* of a query by running the [.show queries](#show-queries) command.|
| *ReasonPhrase* | string | &check; | Describes the reason for canceling the running query and is included in the query results if it's successfully canceled. |

### Example

This example cancels a specific query using *ClientActivityId*.

```kusto
.cancel query "KE.RunQuery;8f70e9ab-958f-4955-99df-d2a288b32b2c"
```
