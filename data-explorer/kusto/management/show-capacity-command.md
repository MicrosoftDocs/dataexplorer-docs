# .show capacity command

Displays capacity for data management operations. For more information, see [Capacity policy](capacity-policy.md).

## Permissions

You must have at least [Database User](access-control/role-based-access-control.md) permissions to run this command.

## Syntax

`.show` `capacity` *Operation* [`with(``scope` `=` `cluster` | `workloadgroup``)`]

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

## Parameters

|Name|Type|Required|Description|
|--|--|--|--|
|*Operation*| `string` ||The name of a specific operation for which to return the capacity, as based on the [capacity policy](../management/capacity-policy.md). See [Supported operations](#supported-operations).|

### Supported operations

The following list outlines the operations for which you can see the capacity:

|Operation|Syntax
|--|--|--|
|[Data export](../management/data-export/index.md)|`data-export`|
|[Extents merge](../management/merge-policy.md)|`extents-merge`|
|[Extents partition](../management/partitioning-policy.md)|`extents-partition`|
|[Ingestions](../../ingest-data-overview.md)|`ingestions`|
|[Materialized view](../management/materialized-views/materialized-view-overview.md)|`materialized-view`|
|[Stored query results](../management/stored-query-results.md)|`stored-query-results`|

For more information on each of the calculations, see [Capacity policy](../management/capacity-policy.md).

## Returns

Returns the results of a calculation for the cluster capacity for each resource.

The capacity can be based on the [workload group](workload-groups.md) specified in the command or the cluster's total capacity. If unspecified, the default scope is `cluster`.

|Output parameter |Type |Description|
|---|---|---|
|Resource | `string` |The name of the resource|
|Total |Int64 |The total amount of resources, of type 'Resource', that are available. For example, the number of concurrent ingestions|
|Consumed |Int64 |The amount of resources of type 'Resource' consumed right now|
|Remaining |Int64 |The amount of remaining resources of type 'Resource'|
|Origin |Int64 |The origin of the limit on concurrent requests ([capacity policy](capacity-policy.md) or [request rate limit policy](request-rate-limit-policy.md))|

## Example

```kusto
.show capacity ingestions
```

**Example output**

|Resource |Total |Consumed |Remaining|Origin|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|ingestions |576 |1 |575|CapacityPolicy/Ingestion|
