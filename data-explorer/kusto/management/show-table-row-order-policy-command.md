# .show table row order policy

Display a table's [row order policy](roworderpolicy.md). The row order policy is an optional policy set on tables, that suggests the desired ordering of rows in a data shard. The purpose of the policy is to improve performance of queries which are known to be narrowed to a small subset of values in the ordered columns.
