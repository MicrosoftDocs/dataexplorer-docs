Deletes all graph snapshots associated with a specific graph model.

## Permissions

To run this command, you need [Database admin permissions](../../access-control/role-based-access-control.md) or [Graph admin permissions](../../access-control/role-based-access-control.md).

## Syntax

`.drop` `graph_snapshots` *GraphModelName*

## Parameters

|Name|Type|Required|Description|
|--|--|--|--|
|*GraphModelName*|String|âœ…|The name of the graph model for which to drop all snapshots.|

## Returns

This command doesn't return any output upon successful completion.

## Examples

### Drop all snapshots for a graph model

```kusto
.drop graph_snapshots SocialNetwork
```

The command completes successfully without returning any output.

## Important notes

- The `.drop graph_snapshots` command permanently deletes all snapshots associated with a graph model. This operation can't be undone.
- Dropping snapshots doesn't affect the graph model itself.
- To drop a specific snapshot instead of all snapshots, use the [`.drop graph_snapshot`](graph-snapshot-drop.md) command.
