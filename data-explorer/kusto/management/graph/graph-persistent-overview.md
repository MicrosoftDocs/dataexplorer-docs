Persistent graphs enable you to store, manage, and query graph data structures at scale. Unlike transient graphs created with the [make-graph](../../query/make-graph-operator.md) operator, persistent graphs are durable database objects that persist beyond individual query executions, providing enterprise-grade graph analytics capabilities.

## Overview

Persistent graphs consist of two primary components:

- **[Graph models](graph-model-overview.md)**: Define the structure and schema of your graph
- **[Graph snapshots](graph-snapshot-overview.md)**: Persistent instances of graph models that you can query

This architecture provides both flexibility in defining graph schemas and efficiency in querying graph data at scale.

## Key benefits

Persistent graphs offer significant advantages for enterprise-scale graph analytics:

- **Durable storage**: Graph models and snapshots persist in database metadata for long-term availability
- **Scalability**: Handle large graphs that exceed single-node memory limitations
- **Reusability**: Multiple users and applications can query the same graph structure without reconstruction
- **Performance optimization**: Eliminate graph construction overhead for repeated queries
- **Schema support**: Structured definitions for different node and edge types with their properties
- **Version control**: Multiple snapshots enable representation of graphs at different points in time

## Graph models

A graph model defines the specifications of a graph stored in your database metadata. It includes:

- **Schema definition**: Node and edge types with their properties
- **Data source mappings**: Instructions for building the graph from tabular data
- **Labels**: Both static (predefined) and dynamic (generated at runtime) labels for nodes and edges

Graph models contain the blueprint for creating graph snapshots, not the actual graph data.

### Managing graph models

The following commands are available for managing graph models:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [.create-or-alter graph_model](graph-model-create-or-alter.md) | Creates a new graph model or alters an existing one |
| [.show graph_model](graph-model-show.md) | Displays details of a specific graph model |
| [.show graph_models](graph-models-show.md) | Lists all graph models in the database |
| [.drop graph_model](graph-model-drop.md) | Removes a graph model |

## Graph snapshots

A graph snapshot is the actual graph instance materialized from a graph model. It represents:

- A specific point-in-time view of the data as defined by the model
- The nodes, edges, and their properties in a queryable format
- A self-contained entity that persists until explicitly removed

Snapshots are the entities you query when working with persistent graphs.

### Managing graph snapshots

The following commands are available for managing graph snapshots:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [.make graph_snapshot](graph-snapshot-make.md) | Creates a new graph snapshot from a graph model |
| [.show graph_snapshot](graph-snapshot-show.md) | Displays details of a specific graph snapshot |
| [.show graph_snapshots](graph-snapshots-show.md) | Lists all graph snapshots in the database |
| [.drop graph_snapshot](graph-snapshot-drop.md) | Removes a single graph snapshot |
| [.drop graph_snapshots](graph-snapshots-drop.md) | Removes multiple graph snapshots based on criteria |

## Workflow

The typical workflow for creating and using persistent graphs follows these steps:

1. **Create a graph model** - Define the structure and data sources for your graph
2. **Create a graph snapshot** - Materialize the graph model into a queryable snapshot
3. **Query the graph snapshot** - Use KQL graph operators to analyze the graph data
4. **Manage lifecycle** - Create new snapshots as needed and drop old ones

## Querying persistent graphs

Once a graph snapshot is created, it can be queried using the [`graph`](../../query/graph-function.md) function followed by other KQL graph operators:

```kusto
graph("MyGraphModel")
| graph-match (n)-[e]->(m)
    project n, e, m
```

To query a specific snapshot, provide the snapshot name:

```kusto
graph("MyGraphModel", "MyGraphSnapshot")
| graph-match (n)-[e]->(m)
    project n, e, m
```

The [`graph-match`](../../query/graph-match-operator.md) operator enables pattern matching and traversal operations, while [`graph-shortest-paths`](../../query/graph-shortest-paths-operator.md) helps find optimal connections between entities. The [`graph-to-table`](../../query/graph-to-table-operator.md) operator converts graph results back to tabular format.

## Key considerations

This section describes key considerations and current limitations of graph models and snapshots.

### Snapshot limitations

Persistent graphs have the following limitations:

- **Regular database limit**: Maximum of 5,000 graph snapshots per database
- **Free virtual cluster limit**: Maximum of 500 graph snapshots per database
- **Snapshot creation time**: Limited to 1 hour
