## Notes

- The `.drop graph_snapshot` command permanently deletes a specific graph snapshot. This operation can't be undone.
- Before dropping a snapshot, ensure that no queries or processes are currently using it.
- Dropping a snapshot doesn't affect the graph model from which it was created.
- To drop all snapshots for a specific graph model, use the [.drop graph_snapshots](graph-snapshots-drop.md) command.
