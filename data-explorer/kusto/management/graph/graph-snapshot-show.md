## Notes

- The `.show graph_snapshot` command provides information about a specific graph snapshot.
- Use the basic format to get essential snapshot information including creation time and model details.
- Use the `details` parameter to get additional information including node count, edge count, and retention policy.
- The retention policy shows the soft delete period, which determines how long the snapshot is retained before being permanently deleted.
