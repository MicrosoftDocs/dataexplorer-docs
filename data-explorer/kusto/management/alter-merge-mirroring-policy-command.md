# .alter-merge table policy mirroring command

::: zone pivot="fabric"

Changes the tables's [mirroring policy](mirroring-policy.md). The mirroring policy creates a logical copy of tables in your database in delta parquet format and allows you to partition your files to improve query speed. Each partition is represented as a separate column using the *PartitionName* listed in the *Partitions* list. This means there are more columns in the target than in your source table.

## Syntax

(`.alter` | `.alter-merge`) `table` *TableName* `policy mirroring`
[`partition` `by` (*Partitions*)] 
`dataformat` = `parquet`  
[`with` (`IsEnabled`=`IsEnabledValue`)]

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

## Parameters

|Name|Type|Required|Description|
|--|--|--|--|
|*TableName*| string| :heavy_check_mark:|A table name that adheres to the [Entity names](../query/schema-entities/entity-names.md) rules.|
|*Partitions*| string| | A comma-separated list of columns used to divide the data into smaller partitions. See [Partitions formatting](#partitions-formatting). |

[!INCLUDE [partitions-formatting](../../includes/partitions-formatting.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Each partition is represented as a separate column using the *PartitionName* listed in the *Partitions* list. *PartitionName* must be a case insensitive unique string, both among other partition names and the column names of the mirrored table.

## Properties

|Name|Type|Description|
|--|--|--|
|`IsEnabled`| `bool`| A Boolean value that determines whether the mirroring policy is enabled. Default is `true`. When the mirroring policy is disabled and set to `false`, the underlying mirroring data is soft-deleted and retained in the database. |

## Examples

### .alter table policy mirroring

In the following example, a table called *myTable* is mirrored. The data is partitioned first by name and then by date.

```kusto
.alter table myTable policy mirroring
  partition by (Name: string=Name, Date: datetime= startofday(timestamp))
  dataformat=parquet
  with
  (IsEnabled=true)
```
