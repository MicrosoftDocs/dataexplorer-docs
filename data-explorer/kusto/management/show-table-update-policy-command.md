# .show table policy update command

Show the table update policy. The [update policy](update-policy.md) simplifies the process of syncing and updating data between two tables. When new data is inserted into the source table, a transformation query runs over this data to modify and insert the data into the target table.

> [!NOTE]
> The source table and the table for which the update policy is defined must be in the same database.
> The update policy function schema and the target table schema must match in their column names, types, and order.
