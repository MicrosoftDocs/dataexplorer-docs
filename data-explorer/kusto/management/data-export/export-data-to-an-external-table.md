# Export data to an external table

You can export data by defining an [external table](../show-external-tables.md) and exporting data to it.
 The table properties are specified when [creating the external table](../external-tables-azurestorage-azuredatalake.md#create-or-alter-external-table).
 The export command references the external table by name.

## Permissions

You must have at least [Table Admin](../access-control/role-based-access-control.md) permissions to run this command.

## Syntax

`.export` [`async`] `to` `table` *externalTableName* <br>
[`with` `(`*propertyName* `=` *propertyValue* [`,` ...]`)`] `<|` *query*

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| *externalTableName* | string | &check; | The name of the external table to which to export.|
| *propertyName*, *propertyValue* | string | | A comma-separated list of optional [properties](#properties).|
| *query* | string | &check; | The export query.|

## Properties

The following properties are supported as part of the export to external table command.

| Property | Type | Description| Default
|---|---|---|---|
| `sizeLimit`     |`long`  |The size limit in bytes of a single storage artifact being written (prior to compression). A full row group of size `parquetRowGroupSize` will be written before checking whether this row group has reached the size limit and should start a new artifact. Allowed range is 100 MB (default) to 1 GB.|
|`distributed`   |`bool`  |Disable/enable distributed export. Setting to false is equivalent to `single` distribution hint. | Default is true.
|`parquetRowGroupSize`|`int`  |Relevant only when data format is Parquet. Controls the row group size in the exported files. This value takes precedence over `sizeLimit`, meaning a full row group will be exported before checking whether this row group has reached the size limit and should start a new artifact. | Default row group size is 100,000 records.|
|`concurrency`|*Number*|Hints the system how many partitions to run in parallel. **See note.**| The default value is 16. |
|`spread`|*Number*|Hints the system how to distribute the partitions among cluster nodes. For example, if there are N partitions and the spread hint is set to P, then the N partitions will be processed by P different cluster nodes equally in parallel/sequentially depending on the concurrency hint.  **See note.**| The default value is 1. |
|`useNativeParquetWriter`|`bool`|Use the new export implementation when exporting to Parquet **See note.**| Default is false. |

>[!NOTE]
> `hint.spread` and `hint.concurrency` are properties used to decrease/increase the concurrency of write operations. For more information, see [partition operator](../../query/partitionoperator.md). These properties are only relevant when exporting to an external table which is partitioned by a string partition. By default, the number of nodes exporting concurrently will be the minimum value between 64 and the number of cluster nodes.

## Authentication and authorization

In order to export to an external table, you must set up write permissions. For more information, see the **Write permissions** for [Azure Storage external table](../external-tables-azurestorage-azuredatalake.md#authentication-and-authorization) or [SQL Server external table](../external-sql-tables.md).

## Output

|Output parameter |Type |Description
|---|---|---
|ExternalTableName  |String |The name of the external table.
|Path|String|Output path.
|NumRecords|String| Number of records exported to path.

## Notes

* The export query output schema must match the schema of the external table, including all columns defined by the partitions. For example, if the table is partitioned by *DateTime*, the query output schema must have a Timestamp column matching the *TimestampColumnName*. This column name is defined in the external table partitioning definition.

* It isn't possible to override the external table properties using the export command.
 For example, you can't export data in Parquet format to an external table whose data format is CSV.

* If the external table is partitioned, exported artifacts are written to their respective directories according to the partition definitions as seen in the [partitioned external table example](#partitioned-external-table-example).
  * If a partition value is null/empty or is an invalid directory value, per the definitions of the target storage, the partition value is replaced with a default value of `__DEFAULT_PARTITION__`.

* For suggestions to overcome storage errors during export commands, see [failures during export commands](export-data-to-storage.md#failures-during-export-commands).

* External table columns are mapped to suitable target format data types, according to [data types mapping](export-data-to-storage.md#data-types-mapping) rules.

* Parquet native export is a more performant, resource light export mechanism. An exported 'datetime' column is currently unsupported by Synapse SQL 'COPY'.

### Number of files

The number of files written per partition depends on the settings:

 * If the external table includes datetime partitions only, or no partitions at all, the number of files written (for each partition, if exists) should be similar to the number of nodes in the cluster (or more, if `sizeLimit` is reached). When the export operation is distributed, all nodes in the cluster export concurrently. To disable distribution, so that only a single node does the writes, set `distributed` to false. This process creates fewer files, but will reduce the export performance.

* If the external table includes a partition by a string column, the number of exported files should be a single file per partition (or more, if `sizeLimit` is reached). All nodes still participate in the export (operation is distributed), but each partition is assigned to a specific node. Setting `distributed` to false, will cause only a single node to do the export, but behavior will remain the same (a single file written per partition).

## Examples

### Non-partitioned external table example

ExternalBlob is a non-partitioned external table. 

```kusto
.export to table ExternalBlob <| T
```

|ExternalTableName|Path|NumRecords|
|---|---|---|
|ExternalBlob|http://storage1.blob.core.windows.net/externaltable1cont1/1_58017c550b384c0db0fea61a8661333e.csv|10|

### Partitioned external table example

PartitionedExternalBlob is an external table, defined as follows: 

```kusto
.create external table PartitionedExternalBlob (Timestamp:datetime, CustomerName:string) 
kind=blob
partition by (CustomerName:string=CustomerName, Date:datetime=startofday(Timestamp))   
pathformat = ("CustomerName=" CustomerName "/" datetime_pattern("yyyy/MM/dd", Date))   
dataformat=csv
( 
   h@'http://storageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/container1;secretKey'
)
```

```kusto
.export to table PartitionedExternalBlob <| T
```

|ExternalTableName|Path|NumRecords|
|---|---|---|
|ExternalBlob|http://storageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/container1/CustomerName=customer1/2019/01/01/fa36f35c-c064-414d-b8e2-e75cf157ec35_1_58017c550b384c0db0fea61a8661333e.csv|10|
|ExternalBlob|http://storageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/container1/CustomerName=customer2/2019/01/01/fa36f35c-c064-414d-b8e2-e75cf157ec35_2_b785beec2c004d93b7cd531208424dc9.csv|10|

If the command is executed asynchronously (by using the `async` keyword), the output is available using the [show operation details](../operations.md#show-operation-details) command.
