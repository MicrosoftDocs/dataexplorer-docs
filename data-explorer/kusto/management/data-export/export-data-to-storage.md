# Export data to storage

Executes a query and writes the first result set to an
external storage, specified by a [storage connection string](../../api/connection-strings/storage.md).

**Syntax**

`.export` [`async`] [`compressed`]
`to` *OutputDataFormat*
`(` *StorageConnectionString* [`,` ...] `)`
[`with` `(` *PropertyName* `=` *PropertyValue* [`,` ...] `)`]
`<|` *Query*

**Arguments**

* `async`: If specified, indicates that the command runs in asynchronous mode.
  See below for more details on the behavior in this mode.

* `compressed`: If specified, the output storage artifacts are compressed
  as `.gz` files. See `compressionType` for compressing parquet files as snappy. 

* *OutputDataFormat*: Indicates the data format of the storage artifacts written
  by the command. Supported values are: `csv`, `tsv`, `json`, and `parquet`.

* *StorageConnectionString*: Specifies one or more [storage connection strings](../../api/connection-strings/storage.md)
  that indicate which storage to write the data to. (More than one storage
  connection string may be specified for scalable writes.) Each such connection 
  string must indicate the credentials to use when writing to storage.
  For example, when writing to Azure Blob Storage, the credentials can be the
  storage account key, or a shared access key (SAS) with the permissions to
  read, write, and list blobs.

> [!NOTE]
> It is highly recommended to export data to storage that is co-located in the
> same region as the Kusto cluster itself. This includes data that is exported so it can be transferred to another cloud service in
> other regions. Writes should be done locally, while reads can happen remotely.

* *PropertyName*/*PropertyValue*: Zero or more optional export properties:

|Property        |Type    |Description                                                                                                                |
|----------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`sizeLimit`     |`long`  |The size limit in bytes of a single storage artifact being written (prior to compression). Allowed range is 100MB (default) to 1GB.|
|`includeHeaders`|`string`|For `csv`/`tsv` output, controls the generation of column headers. Can be one of `none` (default; no header lines emitted), `all` (emit a header line into every storage artifact), or `firstFile` (emit a header line into the first storage artifact only).|
|`fileExtension` |`string`|Indicates the "extension" part of the storage artifact (for example, `.csv` or `.tsv`). If compression is used, `.gz` will be appended as well.|
|`namePrefix`    |`string`|Indicates a prefix to add to each generated storage artifact name. A random prefix will be used if left unspecified.       |
|`encoding`      |`string`|Indicates how to encode the text: `UTF8NoBOM` (default) or `UTF8BOM`. |
|`compressionType`|`string`|Indicates the type of compression to use. Possible values are `gzip` or `snappy`. Default is `gzip`. `snappy` can (optionally) be used for `parquet` format. |
|`distribution`   |`string`  |Distribution hint (`single`, `per_node`, `per_shard`). If value equals `single`, a single thread will write to storage. Otherwise, export will write from all nodes executing the query in parallel. See [evaluate plugin operator](../../query/evaluateoperator.md). Defaults to `per_shard`.
|`distributed`   |`bool`  |Disable/enable distributed export. Setting to false is equivalent to `single` distribution hint. Default is true.
|`persistDetails`|`bool`  |Indicates that the command should persist its results (see `async` flag). Defaults to `true` in async runs, but can be turned off if the caller does not require the results). Defaults to `false` in synchronous executions, but can be turned on in those as well. |
|`parquetRowGroupSize`|`int`  |Relevant only when data format is parquet. Controls the row group size in the exported files. Default row group size is 100000 records.|

**Results**

The commands returns a table that describes the generated storage artifacts.
Each record describes a single artifact and includes the storage path to the
artifact and how many data records it holds.

|Path|NumRecords|
|---|---|
|http://storage1.blob.core.windows.net/containerName/export_1_d08afcae2f044c1092b279412dcb571b.csv|10|
|http://storage1.blob.core.windows.net/containerName/export_2_454c0f1359e24795b6529da8a0101330.csv|15|

**Asynchronous mode**

If the `async` flag is specified, the command executes in asynchronous mode.
In this mode, the command returns immediately with an operation ID, and data
export continues in the background until completion. The operation ID returned
by the command can be used to track its progress and ultimately its results
via the following commands:

* [.show operations](../operations.md#show-operations): Track progress.
* [.show operation details](../operations.md#show-operation-details): Get completion results.

For example, after a successful completion, you can retrieve the results using:

```kusto
.show operation f008dc1e-2710-47d8-8d34-0d562f5f8615 details
```

**Examples** 

In this example, Kusto runs the query and then exports the first recordset produced by the query to one or more compressed CSV blobs.
Column name labels are added as the first row for each blob.

```kusto 
.export
  async compressed
  to csv (
    h@"https://storage1.blob.core.windows.net/containerName;secretKey",
    h@"https://storage1.blob.core.windows.net/containerName2;secretKey"
  ) with (
    sizeLimit=100000,
    namePrefix=export,
    includeHeaders=all,
    encoding =UTF8NoBOM
  )
  <| myLogs | where id == "moshe" | limit 10000
```

#### Known issues

*Storage errors during export command*

By default, the export command is distributed such that all [extents](../extents-overview.md) that contain data to export 
write to storage concurrently. On large exports, when the number of such extents is high, this may lead to high load on 
storage that results in storage throttling, or transient storage errors. In such cases, it is recommended to try increasing
the number of storage accounts provided to the export command (the load will be distributed between the accounts) and/or to 
reduce the concurrency by setting the distribution hint to `per_node` (see command properties). Entirely disabling distribution
 is also possible, but this may significantly impact the command performance.
