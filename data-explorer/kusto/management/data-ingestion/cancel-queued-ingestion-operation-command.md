# .cancel queued ingestion operation command (preview)

> [!INCLUDE [applies](../../includes/applies-to-version/applies.md)] [!INCLUDE [fabric](../../includes/applies-to-version/fabric.md)] [!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer](../../includes/applies-to-version/azure-data-explorer.md)]

The `.cancel queued ingestion operation` command cancels an ingestion operation. This command is useful for aborting an ingestion operation that is taking too long to complete.

The cancel operation command is done on a best effort basis. For example, ongoing ingestion processes or in-flight ingestion, might not get canceled.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Queued ingestion commands are run on the data ingestion URI endpoint `https://ingest-<YourClusterName><Region>.kusto.windows.net`.
