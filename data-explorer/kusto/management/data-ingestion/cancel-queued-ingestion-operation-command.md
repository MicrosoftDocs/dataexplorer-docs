# .cancel queued ingestion operation command (preview)

> [!INCLUDE [applies](../../includes/applies-to-version/applies.md)] [!INCLUDE [fabric](../../includes/applies-to-version/fabric.md)] [!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer](../../includes/applies-to-version/azure-data-explorer.md)]

The `.cancel queued ingestion operation` command cancels an ingestion operation. Use this command to stop an ingestion operation that takes too long to finish.

The cancel operation command works on a best-effort basis. For example, ongoing ingestion processes or in-flight ingestion might not be canceled.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Queued ingestion commands run on the data ingestion URI endpoint `https://ingest-<YourClusterName><Region>.kusto.windows.net`.
