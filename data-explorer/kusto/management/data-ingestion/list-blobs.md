# .list blobs command (preview)

> [!INCLUDE [applies](../../includes/applies-to-version/applies.md)] [!INCLUDE [fabric](../../includes/applies-to-version/fabric.md)] [!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer](../../includes/applies-to-version/azure-data-explorer.md)]

The `.list blobs` command lists blobs under a specified container path.

This command is typically used with [.ingest-from-storage-queued](ingest-from-storage-queued.md) to ingest data. You can also use it on its own to better understand folder contents and parameterize ingestion commands.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Queued ingestion commands are run on the data ingestion URI endpoint `https://ingest-<YourClusterName><Region>.kusto.windows.net`.
>
> - When the command is used on its own, the results might be truncated to limit the number of blobs. However, when used with [.ingest-from-storage-queued](ingest-from-storage-queued.md), no truncation is applied.

## Permissions

You must have at least [Table Ingestor](../../access-control/role-based-access-control.md) permissions to run this command.

## Syntax

`.list blobs` (*SourceDataLocators*) [`Suffix`=*SuffixValue*] [`MaxFiles`=*MaxFilesValue*] [`PathFormat`=*PathFormatValue*]

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

## Parameters

|Name|Type|Required|Description|
|--|--|--|--|
|*SourceDataLocators*| `string` | :heavy_check_mark:|One or many [storage connection strings](../../api/connection-strings/storage-connection-strings.md) separated by a comma character. Each connection string can refer to a storage container or a file prefix within a container. Currently, only one storage connection string is supported. |
|*SuffixValue*| `string` | |The suffix that enables blob filtering.|
|*MaxFilesValue*| `integer` | | The maximum number of blobs to return. |
|*PathFormatValue*| `string` | | The pattern in the blobâ€™s path that can be used to retrieve the creation time as an output field. For more information, see [Path format](#path-format). |

> [!NOTE]
>
> * We recommend using [obfuscated string literals](../../query/scalar-data-types/string.md#obfuscated-string-literals) for *SourceDataLocators*.
>
> * When used alone, `.list blob` returns up to 1,000 files, regardless of any larger value specified in *MaxFiles*.

[!INCLUDE [ingestion-properties](../../includes/ingestion-properties.md)]

## Authentication and authorization

Each storage connection string indicates the authorization method to use for access to the storage. Depending on the authorization method, the principal might need to be granted permissions on the external storage to perform the ingestion.

The following table lists the supported authentication methods and the permissions needed for ingesting data from external storage.

|Authentication method|Azure Blob Storage / Data Lake Storage Gen2|Data Lake Storage Gen1|
|--|--|--|
|[Shared Access (SAS) token](../../api/connection-strings/storage-connection-strings.md#shared-access-sas-token)|List + Read|This authentication method isn't supported in Gen1.|
|[Storage account access key](../../api/connection-strings/storage-connection-strings.md#storage-account-access-key)||This authentication method isn't supported in Gen1.|
|[Managed identity](../../api/connection-strings/storage-connection-strings.md#managed-identity)|Storage Blob Data Reader|Reader|

The primary use of `.list blobs` is for queued ingestion which is done asynchronously with no user context. Therefore, [Impersonation](../../api/connection-strings/storage-connection-strings.md#impersonation) isn't supported.

### Path format

The *PathFormat* parameter allows you to specify the format of the creation time for listed blobs. It consists of a sequence of text separators and partition elements. A partition element refers to a partition that is declared in the partition `by` clause, and the text separator is any text enclosed in quotes. Consecutive partition elements must be set apart using the text separator.

[ *StringSeparator* ] *Partition* [ *StringSeparator* ] [*Partition* [ *StringSeparator* ] ...]

To construct the original file path prefix, partition elements are rendered as strings and separated with corresponding text separators. You can use the `datetime_pattern` macro (`datetime_pattern(`*DateTimeFormat*`,` *PartitionName*`)`) to specify the format used for rendering a datetime partition value. The macro adheres to the .NET format specification, and allows format specifiers to be enclosed in curly brackets. For example, the following two formats are equivalent:

* 'year='yyyy'/month='MM
* year={yyyy}/month={MM}

By default, datetime values are rendered using the following formats:

| Partition function    | Default format |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| `startofyear`         | `yyyy`         |
| `startofmonth`        | `yyyy/MM`      |
| `startofweek`         | `yyyy/MM/dd`   |
| `startofday`          | `yyyy/MM/dd`   |
| `bin(`*Column*`, 1d)` | `yyyy/MM/dd`   |
| `bin(`*Column*`, 1h)` | `yyyy/MM/dd/HH` |
| `bin(`*Column*`, 1m)` | `yyyy/MM/dd/HH/mm` |

## Returns

The result of the command is a table with one record per blob listed.

| Name | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| BlobUri | `string` | The URI of the blob. |
| SizeInBytes | `long` | The number of bytes, or content-length, of the blob. |
| CapturedVariables | `dynamic` | The captured variables. Currently only `CreationTime` is supported. |

## Examples

### List maximum number of blobs

The following command lists a maximum of 20 blobs from the `myfolder` folder using [system-assigned managed identity](../../api/connection-strings/storage-connection-strings.md#managed-identity) authentication.

```kusto
.list blobs (
    "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/datasets/myfolder;managed_identity=system"
)
MaxFiles=20
```

### List Parquet blobs

The following command lists a maximum of 10 blobs of type `.parquet` from a folder, using [system-assigned managed identity](../../api/connection-strings/storage-connection-strings.md#managed-identity) authentication.

```kusto
.list blobs (
    "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/datasets/myfolder;managed_identity=system"
)
Suffix=".parquet"
MaxFiles=10
```

### Capture date from blob path

The following command lists a maximum of 10 blobs of type `.parquet` from a folder, using [system-assigned managed identity](../../api/connection-strings/storage-connection-strings.md#managed-identity) authentication, and extracts the date from the URL path.

```kusto
.list blobs (
    "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/spark/myfolder;managed_identity=system"
)
Suffix=".parquet"
MaxFiles=10
PathFormat=("myfolder/year=" datetime_pattern("yyyy'/month='MM'/day='dd", creationTime) "/")
```

The `PathFormat` parameter can extract dates from various folder hierarchies, such as:

* *Spark* folder paths, for example: `https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/spark/myfolder/year=2024/month=03/day=16/myblob.parquet`

* Common folder paths, for example: `https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/datasets/export/2024/03/16/03/myblob.parquet` where the hour `03` is included in the path.

You can extract the creation time with the following command:

```kusto
.list blobs (
    "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/datasets/export;managed_identity=system"
)
Suffix=".parquet"
MaxFiles=10
PathFormat=("datasets/export/" datetime_pattern("yyyy'/'MM'/'dd'/'HH", creationTime) "/")
```
