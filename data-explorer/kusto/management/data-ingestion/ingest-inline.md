# .ingest inline command (push)

This command inserts data into a table by pushing the data included within the command to the table.

[!INCLUDE [direct-ingestion-note](../../../includes/direct-ingestion-note.md)]

## Permissions

You must have at least [Table Ingestor](../access-control/role-based-access-control.md) permissions to run this command.

## Syntax

`.ingest` `inline` `into` `table` *TableName*
[`with` `(` *IngestionPropertyName* `=` *IngestionPropertyValue* [`,` ...] `)`]
`<|` *Data*

`.ingest` `inline` `into` `table` *TableName*
[`with` `(` *IngestionPropertyName* `=` *IngestionPropertyValue* [`,` ...] `)`]
`[` *Data* `]`

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| *TableName* | `string` |  :heavy_check_mark: | The name of the table into which to ingest data. The table name is always relative to the database in context, and its schema is the schema that will be assumed for the data if no schema mapping object is provided.|
| *Data* | `string` |  :heavy_check_mark: | The data content to ingest. Unless otherwise modified by the ingestion properties, this content is parsed as CSV.|
| *IngestionPropertyName*, *IngestionPropertyValue* | `string` | | Any number of [ingestion properties](../../../ingestion-properties.md) that affect the ingestion process.|

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike most management commands and queries, the text of the *Data* part of the command doesn't have to follow the syntactic conventions of the language. For example, whitespace characters are important, or the `//` combination isn't treated as a comment.

## Returns

The result is a table with as many records
as the number of generated data shards ("extents").
If no data shards are generated, a single record is returned
with an empty (zero-valued) extent ID.

|Name       |Type      |Description                                                               |
|-----------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|ExtentId   |`guid`    |The unique identifier for the data shard that was generated by the command|

## Examples

### Ingest with `<|` syntax

The following command ingests data into a table `Purchases` with two columns: `SKU` (of type `string`) and `Quantity` (of type `long`).

```kusto
.ingest inline into table Purchases <|
    Shoes,1000
    Wide Shoes,50
    "Coats black",20
    "Coats with ""quotes""",5
```

### Ingest with bracket syntax

The following command ingests data into a table `Logs` with two columns: `Date` (of type `datetime`) and `EventDetails` (of type `dynamic`).

```kusto
.ingest inline into table Logs
    [2015-01-01,"{""EventType"":""Read"", ""Count"":""12""}"]
    [2015-01-01,"{""EventType"":""Write"", ""EventValue"":""84""}"]
```
