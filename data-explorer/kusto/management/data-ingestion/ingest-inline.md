# The .ingest inline command (push)

This command ingests data into a table by "pushing" the data
that is embedded inline in the command text itself.

> [!NOTE]
> This command's main purpose is for manual ad-hoc testing purposes.
> For production use it is recommended to use other ingestion methods
> more appropriate for bulk delivery of huge amounts of data,
> such as [ingest from storage](./ingest-from-storage.md).

**Syntax**

`.ingest` `inline` `into` `table` *TableName*
[`with` `(` *IngestionPropertyName* `=` *IngestionPropertyValue* [`,` ...] `)`]
`<|` *Data*



**Arguments**

* *TableName* is the name of the table to ingest data to.
  The table name is always relative to the database in context,
  and its schema is the schema that will be assumed for the data
  if no schema mapping object is provided.

* *Data* is the data content to ingest. Unless otherwise modified
  by the ingestion properties, this content is parsed as CSV.
  Note that unlike most control commands and queries, the text
  of the *Data* part of the command does not have to follow
  the syntactic conventions of the language (e.g., whitespace
  characters are important, the `//` combination is not treated
  as a comment, etc.)

* *IngestionPropertyName*, *IngestionPropertyValue*: Any number of
  [ingestion properties](./index.md#ingestion-properties) that affect the ingestion process.

**Results**

The result of the command is a table with as many records
as there are data shards ("extents") generated by the command.
If no data shards have been generated, a single record is returned
with an empty (zero-valued) extent ID.

|Name       |Type      |Description                                                                |
|-----------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|ExtentId   |`guid`    |The unique identifier for the data shard that was generated by the command.|

**Examples**

The following command ingests data into a table (`Purchases`) with two
columns, `SKU` (of type `string`) and `Quantity` (of type `long`).

```kusto
.ingest inline into table Purchases <|
Shoes,1000
Wide Shoes,50
"Coats, black",20
"Coats with ""quotes""",5
```



<!--
It is possible to generate inline ingests commands using the Kusto.Data client library. (Note that compression does allow one to embed newlines in quoted fields) 

    Kusto.Data.Common.CslCommandGenerator.GenerateTableIngestPushCommand(tableName, compressed: true, csvData: csvStream);
