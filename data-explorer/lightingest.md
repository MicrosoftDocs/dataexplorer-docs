# Use LightIngest to ingest data to Azure Data Explorer
 
LightIngest is a command-line utility for ad-hoc data ingestion into Azure Data Explorer. The utility can pull source data from a local folder or from an Azure blob storage container.
LightIngest is most useful when you want to ingest a large amount of data, because there is no time constraint on ingestion duration. It's also useful when you want to later query records according to the time they were created, and not the time they were ingested.

## Prerequisites

* LightIngest - download it as part of the [Microsoft.Azure.Kusto.Tools NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Kusto.Tools/)

    :::image type="content" source="media/lightingest/lightingest-download-area.png" alt-text="Lightingest download":::

* WinRAR - download it from [www.win-rar.com/download.html](http://www.win-rar.com/download.html)

## Install LightIngest

1. Navigate to the location on your computer where you downloaded LightIngest.
1. Using WinRAR, extract the *tools* directory to your computer.

## Run LightIngest

1. Navigate to the extracted *tools* directory on your computer.
1. Delete the existing location information from the location bar.
    
    :::image type="content" source="kusto/tools/images/KustoTools-Lightingest/lightingest-locationbar.png" alt-text="Delete existing location information for LightIngest":::

1. Enter `cmd` and press **Enter**.
1. At the command prompt, enter `LightIngest.exe` followed by the relevant command-line argument.

    > [!Tip]
    > For a list of supported command-line arguments, enter `LightIngest.exe /help`.
    >
    > :::image type="content" source="media/lightingest/lightingest-cmd-line-help.png" alt-text="Command line help for LightIngest":::

1. Enter `ingest-` followed by the connection string to the Azure Data Explorer cluster that will manage the ingestion.
    Enclose the connection string in double quotes and follow the [Kusto connection strings specification](kusto/api/connection-strings/kusto.md).

    For example:

    ```
    ingest-{Cluster name and region}.kusto.windows.net;AAD Federated Security=True -db:{Database} -table:Trips -source:"https://{Account}.blob.core.windows.net/{ROOT_CONTAINER};{StorageAccountKey}" -pattern:"*.csv.gz" -format:csv -limit:2 -ignoreFirst:true -cr:10.0 -dontWait:true
    ```

### Recommendations

* The recommended method is for LightIngest to work with the ingestion endpoint at `https://ingest-{yourClusterNameAndRegion}.kusto.windows.net`. This way, the Azure Data Explorer service can manage the ingestion load, and you can easily recover from transient errors. However, you can also configure LightIngest to work directly with the engine endpoint (`https://{yourClusterNameAndRegion}.kusto.windows.net`).

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you ingest directly with the engine endpoint, you don't need to include `ingest-`. However, there won't be a DM feature to protect the engine and improve the ingestion success rate.

* For optimal ingestion performance, the raw data size is needed so LightIngest can estimate the uncompressed size of local files. However, LightIngest might not be able to correctly estimate the raw size of compressed blobs without first downloading them. Therefore, when ingesting compressed blobs, set the `rawSizeBytes` property on the blob metadata to uncompressed data size in bytes.

## Azure blob-specific capabilities

When used with Azure blobs, LightIngest will use certain blob metadata properties to augment the ingestion process.

|Metadata property                            | Usage                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`rawSizeBytes`, `kustoUncompressedSizeBytes` | If set, will be interpreted as the uncompressed data size                       |
|`kustoCreationTime`, `kustoCreationTimeUtc`  | Interpreted as UTC timestamp. If set, will be used to override the creation time in Kusto. Useful for backfilling scenarios |

## Usage examples

<!-- Waiting for Tzvia or Vladik to rewrite the instructions for this example before publishing it

### Ingesting a specific number of blobs in JSON format

* Ingest two blobs under a specified storage account {Account}, in `JSON` format matching the pattern `.json`
* Destination is the database {Database}, the table `SampleData`
* Indicate that your data is compressed with the approximate ratio of 10.0
* LightIngest won't wait for the ingestion to be completed

To use the LightIngest command below:
1. Create a table command and enter the table name into the LightIngest command, replacing `SampleData`.
1. Create a mapping command and enter the IngestionMappingRef command, replacing `SampleData_mapping`.
1. Copy your cluster name and enter it into the LightIngest command, replacing `{ClusterandRegion}`.
1. Enter the database name into the LightIngest command, replacing `{Database name}`.
1. Replace `{Account}` with your account name and replace `{ROOT_CONTAINER}?{SAS token}` with the appropriate information.

    ```
    LightIngest.exe "https://ingest-{ClusterAndRegion}.kusto.windows.net;Fed=True"  
        -db:{Database name} 
        -table:SampleData 
        -source:"https://{Account}.blob.core.windows.net/{ROOT_CONTAINER}?{SAS token}" 
        -IngestionMappingRef:SampleData_mapping 
        -pattern:"*.json" 
        -format:JSON 
        -limit:2 
        -cr:10.0 
        -dontWait:true
    ```
     
1. In Azure Data Explorer, open query count.

### How to ingest data using CreationTime

When you load historical data from existing system to Azure Data Explorer, all records receive the same the ingestion date. To enable partitioning your data by creation time and not ingestion time, you can use the `-creationTimePattern` argument. The `-creationTimePattern` argument extracts the `CreationTime` property from the file or blob path. The pattern doesn't need to reflect the entire item path, just the section enclosing the timestamp you want to use.

The argument values must include:
* Constant text immediately preceding the timestamp format, enclosed in single quotes (prefix)
* The timestamp format, in standard [.NET DateTime notation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings)
* Constant text immediately following the timestamp (suffix).

**Examples** 

* A blob name that contains the datetime as follows: `historicalvalues19840101.parquet` (the timestamp is four digits for the year, two digits for the month, and two digits for the day of month), 
    
    The value for `-creationTimePattern` argument is part of the filename: *"'historicalvalues'yyyyMMdd'.parquet'"*

    ```kusto
    ingest-{Cluster name and region}.kusto.windows.net;AAD Federated Security=True -db:{Database} -table:Trips -source:"https://{Account}.blob.core.windows.net/{ROOT_CONTAINER};{StorageAccountKey}" -creationTimePattern:"'historicalvalues'yyyyMMdd'.parquet'"
     -pattern:"*.csv.gz" -format:csv -limit:2 -ignoreFirst:true -cr:10.0 -dontWait:true
    ```

* For a blob URI that refers to hierarchical folder structure, like `https://storageaccount/container/folder/2002/12/01/blobname.extension`, 

    The value for `-creationTimePattern` argument is part of the folder structure: *"'folder/'yyyy/MM/dd'/blob'"*

   ```kusto
    ingest-{Cluster name and region}.kusto.windows.net;AAD Federated Security=True -db:{Database} -table:Trips -source:"https://{Account}.blob.core.windows.net/{ROOT_CONTAINER};{StorageAccountKey}" -creationTimePattern:"'folder/'yyyy/MM/dd'/blob'"
     -pattern:"*.csv.gz" -format:csv -limit:2 -ignoreFirst:true -cr:10.0 -dontWait:true
    ```

### Ingesting blobs using a storage account key or a SAS token

* Ingest 10 blobs under specified storage account `ACCOUNT`, in folder `DIR`, under container `CONT`, and matching the pattern `*.csv.gz`
* Destination is database `DB`, table `TABLE`, and the ingestion mapping `MAPPING` is precreated on the destination
* The tool will wait until the ingest operations complete
* Note the different options for specifying the target database and storage account key vs. SAS token

```
LightIngest.exe "https://ingest-{ClusterAndRegion}.kusto.windows.net;Fed=True"
  -database:DB
  -table:TABLE
  -source:"https://ACCOUNT.blob.core.windows.net/{ROOT_CONTAINER};{StorageAccountKey}"
  -prefix:"DIR"
  -pattern:*.csv.gz
  -format:csv
  -mappingRef:MAPPING
  -limit:10

LightIngest.exe "https://ingest-{ClusterAndRegion}.kusto.windows.net;Fed=True;Initial Catalog=DB"
  -table:TABLE
  -source:"https://ACCOUNT.blob.core.windows.net/{ROOT_CONTAINER}?{SAS token}"
  -prefix:"DIR"
  -pattern:*.csv.gz
  -format:csv
  -mappingRef:MAPPING
  -limit:10
```

### Ingesting all blobs in a container, not including header rows

* Ingest all blobs under specified storage account `ACCOUNT`, in folder `DIR1/DIR2`, under container `CONT`, and matching the pattern `*.csv.gz`
* Destination is database `DB`, table `TABLE`, and the ingestion mapping `MAPPING` is precreated on the destination
* Source blobs contain header line, so the tool is instructed to drop the first record of each blob
* The tool will post the data for ingestion and won't wait for the ingest operations to complete

```
LightIngest.exe "https://ingest-{ClusterAndRegion}.kusto.windows.net;Fed=True"
  -database:DB
  -table:TABLE
  -source:"https://ACCOUNT.blob.core.windows.net/{ROOT_CONTAINER}?{SAS token}"
  -prefix:"DIR1/DIR2"
  -pattern:*.csv.gz
  -format:csv
  -mappingRef:MAPPING
  -ignoreFirstRow:true
```

### Ingesting all JSON files from a path

* Ingest all files under path `PATH`, matching the pattern `*.json`
* Destination is database `DB`, table `TABLE`, and the ingestion mapping is defined in local file `MAPPING_FILE_PATH`
* The tool will post the data for ingestion and won't wait for the ingest operations to complete

```
LightIngest.exe "https://ingest-{ClusterAndRegion}.kusto.windows.net;Fed=True"
  -database:DB
  -table:TABLE
  -source:"PATH"
  -pattern:*.json
  -format:json
  -mappingPath:"MAPPING_FILE_PATH"
```

### Ingesting files and writing diagnostic trace files

* Ingest all files under path `PATH`, matching the pattern `*.json`
* Destination is database `DB`, table `TABLE`, and the ingestion mapping is defined in local file `MAPPING_FILE_PATH`
* The tool will post the data for ingestion and won't wait for the ingest operations to complete
* Diagnostics trace files will be written locally under folder `LOGS_PATH`

```
LightIngest.exe "https://ingest-{ClusterAndRegion}.kusto.windows.net;Fed=True"
  -database:DB
  -table:TABLE
  -source:"PATH"
  -pattern:*.json
  -format:json
  -mappingPath:"MAPPING_FILE_PATH"
  -trace:"LOGS_PATH"
```
