# Automated provisioning in Azure Data Explorer

*Automated provisioning* is a process for quickly deploying and configuring the resources you need to run your Azure Data Explorer cluster. It's a critical part of a DevOps or DataOps workflow. The provisioning process doesn't require you to manually configure the cluster, doesn't require human intervention, and is easy to set up.

You might use automated provisioning to deploy a preconfigured cluster with data, as part of a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. Some of the key benefits of doing so include the ability to:

* Define and maintain multiple [environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment).
* Keep track of deployments in source control.
* More easily roll back to previous versions.
* Facilitate automated testing by provisioning dedicated test environments.

This article provides an overview of the different mechanisms for automating the provisioning of Azure Data Explorer environments, including [infrastructure](#deploy-infrastructure), [schema entities](#deploy-schema-entities), and [data ingestion](#ingest-data). It also provides references to the different tools and techniques used to automate the provisioning process.

## Deploy infrastructure

Infrastructure deployment pertains to the deployment of Azure resources, including clusters, databases, and data connections. There are several different types of infrastructure deployments, including:

* [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template deployment](#arm-template-deployment)
* [Terraform deployment](#terraform-deployment)
* [Imperative deployment](#imperative-deployment)

ARM templates and Terraform scripts are the two main, declarative ways to deploy Azure Data Explorer infrastructure.

### ARM template deployment

ARM templates are [JSON](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) or [Bicep](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview) files that define the infrastructure and configuration of a deployment. You can use the templates to deploy [clusters](/azure/templates/microsoft.kusto/clusters?tabs=json), [databases](/azure/templates/microsoft.kusto/clusters/databases?tabs=json), [data connections](/azure/templates/microsoft.kusto/clusters/databases/dataconnections?tabs=json), and many other infrastructure components. For more information, see [Create an Azure Data Explorer cluster and database by using an Azure Resource Manager template](./create-cluster-database-resource-manager.md).

You can also use ARM templates to deploy [command scripts](/azure/templates/microsoft.kusto/clusters/databases/scripts?tabs=json), which help you create a database schema and define policies. For more information, see [Configure a database by using a Kusto Query Language script](./database-script.md).

You can find more example templates on the [Azure Quickstart Templates](/samples/browse/?expanded=azure&products=azure-resource-manager&terms=data%20explorer) site.

### Terraform deployment

Terraform is an open-source, infrastructure-as-code software tool. It provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage cloud services. Terraform codifies cloud APIs into declarative configuration files.

Terraform offers the same capabilities as ARM templates. You can use Terraform to deploy [clusters](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/kusto_cluster), [databases](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/kusto_database), [data connections](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/kusto_eventgrid_data_connection), and other infrastructure components.

You can also use Terraform to deploy [command scripts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/kusto_script), which help you create a database schema and define policies.

### Imperative deployment

You can also deploy infrastructure imperatively, by using any of the supported platforms:

* [Azure CLI](./create-cluster-database-cli.md)
* [PowerShell](./create-cluster-database-powershell.md)
* SDKs
  * [.NET SDK](./create-cluster-database-csharp.md)
  * [Python SDK](./create-cluster-database-python.md)
  * [Go SDK](./create-cluster-database-go.md)

## Deploy schema entities

Schema entities provisioning pertains to deploying tables, functions, policies, and permissions. You can create or update entities by running scripts that consist of [management commands](kusto/management/management-best-practices.md).

You can automate schema entities deployment by using the following methods:

* [ARM templates](/azure/templates/microsoft.kusto/clusters/databases/scripts?tabs=json)
* [Terraform scripts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/kusto_script)
* [Kusto CLI](./kusto/tools/kusto-cli.md)
* SDKs
  * [.NET SDK](./kusto/api/netfx/about-kusto-data.md)
  * [Python SDK](./kusto/api/python/kusto-python-client-library.md)
  * [Java SDK](./kusto/api/java/kusto-java-client-library.md)
  * [Node SDK](./kusto/api/node/kusto-node-client-library.md)
  * [Go SDK](./kusto/api/golang/kusto-golang-client-library.md)
* Tools
  * [Sync Kusto](./kusto/tools/synckusto.md). Use this interactive developer tool to extract the database schema or management command script. You can then use the extracted content command script for automatic deployment.
  * [Delta Kusto](https://github.com/microsoft/delta-kusto): Invoke this tool in a CI/CD pipeline. It can compare two sources, such as the database schema or management command script, and compute a delta management command script. You can then use the extracted content command script for automatic deployment.
  * [Azure DevOps task](./devops.md) for Azure Data Explorer.

## Ingest data

Sometimes you want to ingest data into your cluster. For example, you might want to ingest data to run tests or re-create an environment. You can use the following methods to ingest data:

* SDKs
  * [.NET SDK](./net-sdk-ingest-data.md)
  * [Python SDK](./python-ingest-data.md)
  * [Java SDK](./java-ingest-data.md)
  * [Node SDK](./node-ingest-data.md)
  * [Go SDK](./go-ingest-data.md)
* [LightIngest](./lightingest.md) CLI tool
* Triggering an [Azure Data Factory pipeline](./data-factory-integration.md)

## Example deployment using a CI/CD pipeline

In the following example, you use an Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline that runs tools to automate the deployment of infrastructure, schema entities, and data. This is one example of a pipeline that uses a particular set of tools, but you can use other tools and steps. For example, in a production environment, you might want to create a pipeline that doesn't ingest data. You can also add further steps to the pipeline, such as running automated tests on the created cluster.

Here, you use the following tools:

|Deployment type|Tool|Task|
|--|--|--|
|Infrastructure|ARM templates|Create a cluster and a database|
|Schema entities|Kusto CLI|Create tables in the database|
|Data|LightIngest|Ingest data into one table|

:::image type="content" source="media/automated-deploy-overview/flow-sample.png" alt-text="Image showing the deployment example flow." border="false":::

Use the following steps to create a pipeline.

### Step 1: Create a service connection

Define a [service connection](/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints) of type *Azure Resource Manager*. Point the connection to the subscription and resource group where you want to deploy your cluster to. An Azure service principal is created, and you use it to deploy the ARM template. You can use the same principal to deploy the schema entities and ingest data. You must explicitly pass the credentials to Kusto CLI and LightIngest tools.

### Step 2: Create a pipeline

Define the pipeline (*deploy-environ*) that you'll use to deploy the cluster, create schema entities, and ingest data.

Before you can use the pipeline, you must create the following [secret variables](/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=classic%2Cbatch&preserve-view=true):

| Variable name | Description |
|--|--|
| `clusterName` | The name of the Azure Data Explorer cluster. |
| `serviceConnection` | The name of the Azure DevOps connection used to deploy the ARM template. |
| `appId` | The client ID of the service principal used to interact with the cluster. |
| `appSecret` | The secret of the service principal. |
| `appTenantId` | The tenant ID of the service principal. |
| `location` | The Azure region where you'll deploy the cluster. For example, `eastus`. |

```yml
resources:
- repo: self

stages:
- stage: deploy_cluster
  displayName: Deploy cluster
  variables: []
    clusterName: specifyClusterName
    serviceConnection: specifyServiceConnection
    appId: specifyAppId
    appSecret: specifyAppSecret
    appTenantId: specifyAppTenantId
    location: specifyLocation
  jobs:
  - job: e2e_deploy
    pool:
      vmImage: windows-latest
    variables: []
    steps:
    - bash: |
        nuget install Microsoft.Azure.Kusto.Tools -Version 5.3.1
        # Rename the folder (including the most recent version)
        mv Microsoft.Azure.Kusto.Tools.* kusto.tools
      displayName: Download required Kusto.Tools Nuget package
    - task: AzureResourceManagerTemplateDeployment@3
      displayName: Deploy Infrastructure
      inputs:
        deploymentScope: 'Resource Group'
        # subscriptionId and resourceGroupName are specified in the serviceConnection
        azureResourceManagerConnection: $(serviceConnection)
        action: 'Create Or Update Resource Group'
        location: $(location)
        templateLocation: 'Linked artifact'
        csmFile: deploy-infra.json
        overrideParameters: "-clusterName $(clusterName)"
        deploymentMode: 'Incremental'
    - bash: |
        # Define connection string to cluster's database, including service principal's credentials
        connectionString="https://$(clusterName).$(location).kusto.windows.net/myDatabase;Fed=true;AppClientId=$(appId);AppKey=$(appSecret);TenantId=$(appTenantId)"
        # Execute a KQL script against the database
        kusto.tools/tools/Kusto.Cli $connectionString -script:MyDatabase.kql
      displayName: Create Schema Entities
    - bash: |
        connectionString="https://ingest-$(CLUSTERNAME).$(location).kusto.windows.net/;Fed=true;AppClientId=$(appId);AppKey=$(appSecret);TenantId=$(appTenantId)"
        kusto.tools/tools/LightIngest $connectionString -table:Customer -sourcePath:customers.csv -db:myDatabase -format:csv -ignoreFirst:true
      displayName: Ingest Data
```

### Step 3: Create an ARM template to deploy the cluster

Define the ARM template (*deploy-infra.json*) that you'll use to deploy the cluster to your subscription and resource group.

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "parameters": {
        "clusterName": {
            "type": "string",
            "minLength": 5
        }
    },
    "variables": {
    },
    "resources": [
        {
            "name": "[parameters('clusterName')]",
            "type": "Microsoft.Kusto/clusters",
            "apiVersion": "2021-01-01",
            "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
            "sku": {
                "name": "Dev(No SLA)_Standard_E2a_v4",
                "tier": "Basic",
                "capacity": 1
            },
            "resources": [
                {
                    "name": "myDatabase",
                    "type": "databases",
                    "apiVersion": "2021-01-01",
                    "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
                    "dependsOn": [
                        "[resourceId('Microsoft.Kusto/clusters', parameters('clusterName'))]"
                    ],
                    "kind": "ReadWrite",
                    "properties": {
                        "softDeletePeriodInDays": 365,
                        "hotCachePeriodInDays": 31
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Step 4: Create a KQL script to create the schema entities

Define the KQL script (*MyDatabase.kql*) that you'll use to create the tables in the databases.

```kusto
.create table Customer(CustomerName:string, CustomerAddress:string)

//  Set the ingestion batching policy to trigger ingestion quickly
//  This is to speedup reaction time for the sample
//  Do not do this in production
.alter table Customer policy ingestionbatching @'{"MaximumBatchingTimeSpan":"00:00:10", "MaximumNumberOfItems": 500, "MaximumRawDataSizeMB": 1024}'

.create table CustomerLogs(CustomerName:string, Log:string)
```

### Step 5: Create a KQL script to ingest data

Create the CSV data file (*customer.csv*) to ingest.

```text
customerName,customerAddress
Contoso Ltd,Paris
Datum Corporation,Seattle
Fabrikam,NYC
```

:::image type="content" source="media/automated-deploy-overview/devops-job.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a job run of the example flow.":::

You create the cluster by using the service principal credentials that you specified in the pipeline. To give permissions to your users, follow the steps in [Manage Azure Data Explorer database permissions](manage-database-permissions.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/automated-deploy-overview/deployed-database.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the deployed database with its two tables in Azure Data Explorer web UI.":::

You can verify the deployment by running a query against the *Customer* table. You should see the three records that were imported from the CSV file.
