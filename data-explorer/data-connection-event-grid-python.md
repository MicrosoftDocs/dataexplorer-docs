In this article, you create an Event Grid data connection for Azure Data Explorer by using Python.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio).
* [Python 3.4+](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* [A cluster and database](create-cluster-database-python.md).
* [Table and column mapping](net-standard-ingest-data.md#create-a-table-on-your-test-cluster).
* [Database and table policies](database-table-policies-csharp.md) (optional).
* [A storage account with an Event Grid subscription](ingest-data-event-grid.md).

## Add an Event Grid data connection

The following example shows you how to add an Event Grid data connection programmatically. See [create an Event Grid data connection in Azure Data Explorer](ingest-data-event-grid.md#create-an-event-grid-data-connection-in-azure-data-explorer) for adding an Event Grid data connection using the Azure portal.


```Python
from azure.mgmt.kusto import KustoManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.kusto.models import EventGridDataConnection
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

#Directory (tenant) ID
tenant_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
#Application ID
client_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
#Client Secret
client_secret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
subscription_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
        client_id=client_id,
        secret=client_secret,
        tenant=tenant_id
    )
kusto_management_client = KustoManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
