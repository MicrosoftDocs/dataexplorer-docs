# Monitor Azure Data Explorer performance, health, and usage with metrics

Azure Data Explorer metrics provide key indicators as to the health and performance of the Azure Data Explorer cluster resources. Use the metrics that are detailed in this article to monitor Azure Data Explorer cluster usage, health, and performance in your specific scenario as standalone metrics. You can also use metrics as the basis for operational [Azure Dashboards](/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-dashboards) and [Azure Alerts](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#metric-alerts).

For more information about Azure Metrics Explorer, see [Metrics Explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-getting-started).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. Create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Create [a cluster and database](create-cluster-database-portal.md).

## Use metrics to monitor your Azure Data Explorer resources

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. In the left-hand pane of your Azure Data Explorer cluster, search for *metrics*.
1. Select **Metrics** to open the metrics pane and begin analysis on your cluster.

1. To create a metric chart, select **Metric** name and relevant **Aggregation** per metric. For more information about different metrics, see [supported Azure Data Explorer metrics](#supported-azure-data-explorer-metrics).
1. Select **Add metric** to see multiple metrics plotted in the same chart.
1. Select **+ New chart** to see multiple charts in one view.
1. Use the time picker to change the time range (default: past 24 hours).
1. Use [**Add filter** and **Apply splitting**](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-getting-started#apply-dimension-filters-and-splitting) for metrics that have dimensions.
1. Select **Pin to dashboard** to add your chart configuration to the dashboards so that you can view it again.
1. Set **New alert rule** to visualize your metrics using the set criteria. The new alerting rule will include your target resource, metric, splitting, and filter dimensions from your chart. Modify these settings in the [alert rule creation pane](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-charts#create-alert-rules).

## Cluster metrics

The cluster metrics track the general health of the cluster. For example, resource and ingestion use and responsiveness.

|**Metric** | **Unit** | **Aggregation** | **Metric description** | **Dimensions** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cache utilization | Percent | Avg, Max, Min | Percentage of allocated cache resources currently in use by the cluster. Cache is the size of SSD allocated for user activity according to the defined cache policy. <br> <br> An average cache utilization of 80% or less is a sustainable state for a cluster. If the average cache utilization is above 80%, the cluster should be <br> [scaled up](manage-cluster-vertical-scaling.md) to a storage optimized pricing tier or <br> [scaled out](manage-cluster-horizontal-scaling.md) to more instances. Alternatively, adapt the cache policy (fewer days in cache). If cache utilization is over 100%, the size of data to be cached, according to the caching policy, is larger that the total size of cache on the cluster. | None |
| CPU | Percent | Avg, Max, Min | Percentage of allocated compute resources currently in use by machines in the cluster. <br> <br> An average CPU of 80% or less is sustainable for a cluster. The maximum value of CPU is 100%, which means there are no additional compute resources to process data. <br> When a cluster isn't performing well, check the maximum value of the CPU to determine if there are specific CPUs that are blocked. | None |
| Ingestion utilization | Percent | Avg, Max, Min | Percentage of actual resources used to ingest data from the total resources allocated, in the capacity policy, to perform ingestion. The default capacity policy is no more than 512 concurrent ingestion operations or 75% of the cluster resources invested in ingestion. <br> <br> Average ingestion utilization of 80% or less is a sustainable state for a cluster. Maximum value of ingestion utilization is 100%, which means all cluster ingestion ability is used and an ingestion queue may result. | None |
| InstanceCount | Count	| Avg |	Total instance count. |
| Keep alive | Count | Avg | Tracks the responsiveness of the cluster. <br> <br> A fully responsive cluster returns value 1 and a blocked or disconnected cluster returns 0. |
| Total number of throttled commands | Count | Avg, Max, Min, Sum | The number of throttled (rejected) commands in the cluster, since the maximum allowed number of concurrent (parallel) commands was reached. | None |
| Total number of extents | Count | Avg, Max, Min, Sum | Total number of data extents in the cluster. <br> <br> Changes in this metric can imply massive data structure changes and high load on the cluster, since merging data extents is a CPU-heavy activity. | None |
| Follower latency | Seconds | Avg, Max, Min | The follower databases synchronize changes in the leader databases. Because of the synchronization, thereâ€™s a data lag of a few seconds to a few minutes in data availability. <br> <br> This metric measures the length of the time lag. The time lag depends on several factors like: the overall size and rate of the ingested data to the leader, the number of databases followed, the rate of internal operations performed on the leader (merge/rebuild operations). <br> <br> This is a cluster level metrics: the followers catch metadata of all databases that are followed. This metric represents the latency of the process. | None |

## Export metrics

Export metrics track the general health and performance of export operations like lateness, results, number of records, and utilization.

|**Metric** | **Unit** | **Aggregation** | **Metric description** | **Dimensions** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
Continuous export number of exported records	| Count	| Sum |	The number of exported records in all continuous export jobs. | ContinuousExportName |
Continuous export max lateness |	Count	| Max	| The lateness (in minutes) reported by the continuous export jobs in the cluster. | None |
Continuous export pending count	| Count	| Max	| The number of pending continuous export jobs. These jobs are ready to run but waiting in a queue, possibly due to insufficient capacity). 
Continuous export result	| Count |	Count	| The Failure/Success result of each continuous export run. | ContinuousExportName |
Export utilization |	Percent	| Max	| Export capacity used, out of the total export capacity in the cluster (between 0 and 100). | None |

## Ingestion metrics

Ingestion metrics track the general health and performance of ingestion operations like latency, results, and volume.
To refine your analysis: 
* [Apply filters to charts](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-charts#apply-filters-to-charts) to plot partial data by dimensions. For example, explore ingestion to a specific `Database`.
* [Apply splitting to a chart](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-charts#apply-splitting-to-a-chart) to visualize data by different components. This process is useful for analyzing metrics that are reported by each step of the ingestion pipeline, for example `Blobs received`.

| Events processed (for Event/IoT Hubs) | Count | Max, Min, Sum | Total number of events read from event hubs and processed by the cluster. These events are split into two groups: events rejected, and events accepted by the cluster engine. | Status |
| Ingestion latency | Seconds | Avg, Max, Min | Latency of data ingested, from the time the data was received in the cluster until it's ready for query. The ingestion latency period depends on the ingestion scenario. | None |
| Ingestion result  | Count | Sum | Total number of sources that either failed or succeeded to be ingested.<br> `Status`: **Success** for successful ingestion or the failure category for failures. For a complete list of possible failure categories see [Ingestion error codes in Azure Data Explorer](error-codes.md). <br> `Failure Status Type`: Whether the failure is permanent or transient. For successful ingestion, this dimension is `None`.<br><br>**Note:**<br><ul><li> Event Hub and IoT Hub ingestion events are pre-aggregated into one blob, and then treated as a single source to be ingested. Therefore, pre-aggregated events appear as a single ingestion result after pre-aggregation.</li><br><li>Transient failures are retried internally a limited number of times. Each transient failure is reported as a transient ingestion result. Therefore, a single ingestion may result in more than one ingestion result. </li></ul> | Status, Failure Status Type |
| Ingestion volume (in MB) | Count | Max, Sum | The total size of data ingested to the cluster (in MB) before compression. | Database |
| Queue length | Count | Avg | Number of pending messages in a component's input queue. The batching manager component has one message per blob. The ingestion manager component has one message per batch. A batch is a single ingest command with one or more blobs.  | Component Type |
| Queue oldest message | Seconds | Avg | Time in seconds from when the oldest message in a component's input queue has been inserted. | Component Type | 
| Received data size bytes | Bytes | Avg, Sum | Size of data received by data connections from input stream. | Component Type, Component Name |
| Stage latency | Seconds | Avg | Time from when a message is accepted by Azure Data Explorer, until its content is received by an ingestion component for processing. <br> <br> Use **apply filters** and select **Component Type > EngineStorage** to show the total ingestion latency.| Database, Component Type |
