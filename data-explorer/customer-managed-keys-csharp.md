## Configure encryption with customer-managed keys

This section shows you how to configure customer-managed keys encryption using the Azure Data Explorer C# client. 

### Prerequisites

* If you don't have Visual Studio 2019 installed, you can download and use the **free** [Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). Make sure that you enable **Azure development** during the Visual Studio setup.

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

### Install C# NuGet

* Install the [Azure Data Explorer (Kusto) NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Management.Kusto/).

* Install the [Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory/) for authentication.

### Authentication

To run the examples in this article, [create an Azure AD application](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal) and service principal that can access resources. You can add role assignment at the subscription scope and get the required `Directory (tenant) ID`, `Application ID`, and `Client Secret`.

### Configure cluster

By default, Azure Data Explorer encryption uses Microsoft-managed keys. Configure your Azure Data Explorer cluster to use customer-managed keys and specify the key to associate with the cluster.

1. Update your cluster by using the following code:

    ```csharp
    var tenantId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx";//Directory (tenant) ID
    var clientId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx";//Application ID
    var clientSecret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx";//Client Secret
    var subscriptionId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx";
    var authenticationContext = new AuthenticationContext($"https://login.windows.net/{tenantId}");
    var credential = new ClientCredential(clientId, clientSecret);
    var result = await authenticationContext.AcquireTokenAsync(resource: "https://management.core.windows.net/", clientCredential: credential);

    var credentials = new TokenCredentials(result.AccessToken, result.AccessTokenType);

    var kustoManagementClient = new KustoManagementClient(credentials)
    {
        SubscriptionId = subscriptionId
    };

    var resourceGroupName = "testrg";
    var clusterName = "mykustocluster";
    var keyName = "myKey";
    var keyVersion = "5b52b20e8d8a42e6bd7527211ae32654";
    var keyVaultUri = "https://mykeyvault.vault.azure.net/";
    var keyVaultProperties = new KeyVaultProperties (keyName, keyVersion, keyVaultUri);
    var clusterUpdate = new ClusterUpdate(keyVaultProperties: keyVaultProperties);
    await kustoManagementClient.Clusters.UpdateAsync(resourceGroupName, clusterName, clusterUpdate);
    ```

1. Run the following command to check if your cluster was successfully updated:

    ```csharp
    kustoManagementClient.Clusters.Get(resourceGroupName, clusterName);
    ```

    If the result contains `ProvisioningState` with the `Succeeded` value, then your cluster was successfully updated.

## Update the key version

When you create a new version of a key, you'll need to update the cluster to use the new version. First, call `Get-AzKeyVaultKey` to get the latest version of the key. Then update the cluster's key vault properties to use the new version of the key, as shown in [Configure cluster](#configure-cluster).
