# Add a cluster connection in the Azure Data Explorer web UI

This article explains how to add a cluster connection in the [Azure Data Explorer web UI](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/).

The Azure Data Explorer web UI allows you to seamlessly manage clusters from various user accounts or Microsoft Entra directories. Follow the optional steps in this article to set up connections with alternative credentials. Once connected, you can switch between clusters associated with different credentials within a unified interface, without a need to repeatedly sign in and sign out or switch directories.

## Prerequisites

* A Microsoft account or a Microsoft Entra user identity. An Azure subscription isn't required.

## Add a cluster connection

To add a connection to your Azure Data Explorer cluster:

1. From the main left menu, select **Query**.

1. In the upper left corner, select **Add**. From the dropdown menu, select **Connection**.

1. In the **Add connection** dialog box, enter the cluster **Connection URI** and **Display name**. To find the connection URI, go to your cluster resource in the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/). The connection URI is the **URI** found in the **Overview**. To add a free sample cluster, specify "help" as the **Connection URI**.

1. (Optional) If you have multiple user accounts and want to authenticate with a different account, select **Connect as another user** and proceed to add or select the appropriate account.

1. (Optional) If your account is linked to multiple Microsoft Entra directories, select **Switch directory** and choose the relevant directory for this connection.

1. Select **Add** to add the connection. Your cluster and databases should now be visible in the left panel.

    For example, the following image shows a cluster connection pane that contains three clusters: `help`, `FreeCluster`, and `HomeCluster`. The `HomeCluster` connection uses different credentials from those of the signed-in user, as indicated by the small icon of a person in the upper-left corner.
