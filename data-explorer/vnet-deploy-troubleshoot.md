# Troubleshoot access, ingestion, and operation of your Azure Data Explorer cluster in your virtual network

> [!WARNING]
> Virtual Network Injection will be retired for Azure Data Explorer by 1 February 2025. For more information on the deprecation, see [Deprecation of Virtual Network Injection for Azure Data Explorer](https://aka.ms/adx.security.vnet.deprecation).

In this section you learn how to troubleshoot connectivity, operational, and cluster creation issues for a cluster that is deployed into your [Virtual Network](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview).

## Access issues

If you have an issue while accessing cluster using the public (cluster.region.kusto.windows.net) or private (private-cluster.region.kusto.windows.net) endpoint and you suspect it's related to virtual network setup, perform the following steps to troubleshoot the issue.

### Check TCP connectivity

The first step includes checking TCP connectivity using Windows or Linux OS.

#### [Windows](#tab/windows)

1. Download [TCping](https://www.elifulkerson.com/projects/tcping.php) to the machine connecting to the cluster.
1. Ping the destination from the source machine by using the following command:

    ```cmd
    C:\> tcping -t yourcluster.kusto.windows.net 443
    ** Pinging continuously.  Press control-c to stop **
    Probing 1.2.3.4:443/tcp - Port is open - time=100.00ms
    ```

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

1. Install *netcat* in the machine connecting to the cluster

    ```bash
    apt-get install netcat
    ```

1. Ping the destination from the source machine by using the following command:

    ```bash
    $ netcat -z -v yourcluster.kusto.windows.net 443
    Connection to yourcluster.kusto.windows.net 443 port [tcp/https] succeeded!
    ```

---

If the test isn't successful, proceed with the following steps. If the test is successful, the issue isn't due to a TCP connectivity issue. Go to [operational issues](#cluster-creation-and-operations-issues) to troubleshoot further.

### Check Network Security Group (NSG) rules

Check that the [NSG](/azure/virtual-network/security-overview) attached to the cluster's subnet, has an inbound rule that allows access from the client machine's IP for port 443.

### Check the route table is configured to prevent access issues

If the cluster's subnet is configured to force tunnel all internet-bound traffic back to your firewall (subnet with a [route table](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview) that contains the default route '0.0.0.0/0'), make sure that the machine IP address has a route with [next hop type](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview) to VirtualNetwork/Internet. This route is required to prevent asymmetric route issues.

## Ingestion issues

If you're experiencing ingestion issues and you suspect it's related to virtual network setup, perform the following steps.

### Check ingestion health

Check that the [cluster ingestion metrics](using-metrics.md#ingestion-metrics) indicate a healthy state.

### Check security rules on data source resources

If the metrics indicate that no events were processed from the data source (*Events processed* metric for Event/IoT Hubs), make sure that the data source resources (Event Hubs or Storage) allow access from cluster's subnet in the firewall rules or service endpoints.

### Check security rules configured on cluster's subnet

Make sure cluster's subnet has NSG, UDR, and firewall rules are properly configured. In addition, test network connectivity for all dependent endpoints.

## Cluster creation and operations issues

If you're experiencing cluster creation or operation issues and you suspect it's related to virtual network setup, follow these steps to troubleshoot the issue.

### Check the "DNS servers" configuration

Setting up Private Endpoint requires configuring DNS, We support Azure Private DNS zone setup only. Custom DNS server setup isn't support, check that the records that were created as part of private endpoint are registered to Azure Private DNS zone.

### Diagnose the virtual network with the REST API

The [ARMClient](https://chocolatey.org/packages/ARMClient) is used to call the REST API using PowerShell.

1. Sign in with ARMClient

    ```powerShell
    armclient login
    ```

1. Invoke diagnose operation

    ```powershell
    $subscriptionId = '<subscription id>'
    $clusterName = '<name of cluster>'
    $resourceGroupName = '<resource group name>'
    $apiversion = '2019-11-09'

    armclient post "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/$subscriptionId/resourceGroups/$resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.Kusto/clusters/$clusterName/diagnoseVirtualNetwork?api-version=$apiversion" - verbose
    ```

1. Check the response

    ```powershell
    HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
    ...
    Azure-AsyncOperation: https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/providers/Microsoft.Kusto/locations/{location}/operationResults/{operation-id}?api-version=2019-11-09
    ...
    ```

1. Wait for operation completion

    ```powershell
    armclient get https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/$subscriptionId/providers/Microsoft.Kusto/locations/{location}/operationResults/{operation-id}?api-version=2019-11-09

    {
      "id": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/providers/Microsoft.Kusto/locations/{location}/operationresults/{operation-id}",
      "name": "{operation-name}",
      "status": "[Running/Failed/Completed]",
      "startTime": "{start-time}",
      "endTime": "{end-time}",
      "properties": {...}
    }
    ```

   Wait until the *status* property shows *Completed*, then the *properties* field should show:

    ```powershell
    {
      "id": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/providers/Microsoft.Kusto/locations/{location}/operationresults/{operation-id}",
      "name": "{operation-name}",
      "status": "Completed",
      "startTime": "{start-time}",
      "endTime": "{end-time}",
      "properties": {
        "Findings": [...]
      }
    }
    ```

If the *Findings* property shows an empty result, it means that all network tests passed and no connections are broken. If the following error is shown, *Outbound dependency '{dependencyName}:{port}' might be not satisfied (Outbound)*, the cluster can't reach the dependent service endpoints. Proceed with the following steps.

### Check NSG rules

Make sure that the [NSG](/azure/virtual-network/security-overview) is configured properly per the instructions in [Configure Network Security Group rules](vnet-deployment.md#configure-network-security-group-rules).

### Check the route table is configured to prevent ingestion issues

If the cluster's subnet is configured to force tunnel all internet-bound traffic back to your firewall (subnet with a [route table](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview) that contains the default route '0.0.0.0/0') make sure that the [management IP addresses](vnet-deployment.md#azure-data-explorer-management-ip-addresses)) and [health monitoring IP addresses](vnet-deployment.md#health-monitoring-addresses) have a route with [next hop type](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview##next-hop-types-across-azure-tools) *Internet*, and [source address prefix](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview#how-azure-selects-a-route) to *'management-ip/32'* and *'health-monitoring-ip/32'*. This route required to prevent asymmetric route issues.

### Check firewall rules

If you force tunnel subnet outbound traffic to a firewall, make sure all dependencies FQDN (for example, *.blob.core.windows.net*) are allowed in the firewall configuration as described in [securing outbound traffic with firewall](vnet-deployment.md#securing-outbound-traffic-with-a-firewall).

## Cluster suspension issues

If the cluster fails to suspend, confirm that there aren't any locks on the networking resources in your subscription.
