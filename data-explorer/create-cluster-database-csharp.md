Azure Data Explorer is a fast, fully managed data analytics service for real-time analysis on large volumes of data streaming from applications, websites, IoT devices, and more. To use Azure Data Explorer, you first create a cluster, and create one or more databases in that cluster. Then you ingest (load) data into a database so that you can run queries against it. In this article, you create a cluster and a database by using C#.

## Prerequisites

* If you don't have Visual Studio 2019 installed, you can download and use the **free** [Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). Make sure that you enable **Azure development** during the Visual Studio setup.
* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Authentication
For running the examples in this article, we need an Azure AD Application and service principal that can access resources. Check [create an Azure AD application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal) to create a free Azure AD Application and add role assignment at the subscription scope. It also shows how to get the `Directory (tenant) ID`, `Application ID`, and `Client Secret`.

## Create the Azure Data Explorer cluster

1. Create your cluster by using the following code:

    ```csharp
    var tenantId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx";//Directory (tenant) ID
    var clientId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx";//Application ID
    var clientSecret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx";//Client Secret
    var subscriptionId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx";
    var authenticationContext = new AuthenticationContext($"https://login.windows.net/{tenantId}");
    var credential = new ClientCredential(clientId, clientSecret);
    var result = await authenticationContext.AcquireTokenAsync(resource: "https://management.core.windows.net/", clientCredential: credential);

    var credentials = new TokenCredentials(result.AccessToken, result.AccessTokenType);

    var kustoManagementClient = new KustoManagementClient(credentials)
    {
        SubscriptionId = subscriptionId
    };

    var resourceGroupName = "testrg";
    var clusterName = "mykustocluster";
    var location = "Central US";
    var skuName = "Standard_D13_v2";
    var tier = "Standard";
    var capacity = 5;
    var sku = new AzureSku(skuName, tier, capacity);
    var cluster = new Cluster(location, sku);
    await kustoManagementClient.Clusters.CreateOrUpdateAsync(resourceGroupName, clusterName, cluster);
    ```

   |**Setting** | **Suggested value** | **Field description**|
   |---|---|---|
   | clusterName | *mykustocluster* | The desired name of your cluster.|
   | skuName | *Standard_D13_v2* | The SKU that will be used for your cluster. |
   | tier | *Standard* | The SKU tier. |
   | capacity | *number* | The number of instances of the cluster. |
   | resourceGroupName | *testrg* | The resource group name where the cluster will be created. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > **Create a cluster** is a long running operation, so it's highly recommended to use CreateOrUpdateAsync, instead of CreateOrUpdate. 

1. Run the following command to check whether your cluster was successfully created:

    ```csharp
    kustoManagementClient.Clusters.Get(resourceGroupName, clusterName);
    ```

If the result contains `ProvisioningState` with the `Succeeded` value, then the cluster was successfully created.

## Create the database in the Azure Data Explorer cluster

1. Create your database by using the following code:

    ```csharp
    var hotCachePeriod = new TimeSpan(3650, 0, 0, 0);
    var softDeletePeriod = new TimeSpan(3650, 0, 0, 0);
    var databaseName = "mykustodatabase";
    var database = new ReadWriteDatabase(location: location, softDeletePeriod: softDeletePeriod, hotCachePeriod: hotCachePeriod);

    await kustoManagementClient.Databases.CreateOrUpdateAsync(resourceGroupName, clusterName, databaseName, database);
    ```

        [!NOTE]
        If you are using C# version 2.0.0 or below, use Database instead of ReadWriteDatabase.

   |**Setting** | **Suggested value** | **Field description**|
   |---|---|---|
   | clusterName | *mykustocluster* | The name of your cluster where the database will be created.|
   | databaseName | *mykustodatabase* | The name of your database.|
   | resourceGroupName | *testrg* | The resource group name where the cluster will be created. |
   | softDeletePeriod | *3650:00:00:00* | The amount of time that data will be kept available to query. |
   | hotCachePeriod | *3650:00:00:00* | The amount of time that data will be kept in cache. |

2. Run the following command to see the database that you created:

    ```csharp
    kustoManagementClient.Databases.Get(resourceGroupName, clusterName, databaseName) as ReadWriteDatabase;
    ```

You now have a cluster and a database.

## Clean up resources

* If you plan to follow our other articles, keep the resources you created.
* To clean up resources, delete the cluster. When you delete a cluster, it also deletes all the databases in it. Use the following command to delete your cluster:

    ```csharp
    kustoManagementClient.Clusters.Delete(resourceGroupName, clusterName);
    ```
