# Share dashboards

A dashboard is a collection of tiles, optionally organized in pages, where each tile has an underlying query and a visual representation. For more information on creating dashboards, see [Visualize data with Azure Data Explorer dashboards](azure-data-explorer-dashboards.md).

In this document, you'll learn how to grant permissions and manage permissions to share a dashboard with other users.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To access the dashboard, a dashboard viewer needs the following:
>
> * Dashboard link for access
> * Dashboard permissions
> * Access to the underlying database in the Azure Data Explorer cluster

In general, dashboards are shared in two steps: Grant permissions, and share the dashboard link. When granting permissions to a user in a different tenant, the user must additionally accept the invitation to access the dashboard.

## Manage permissions

1. Browse to your [Azure Data Explorer dashboards](azure-data-explorer-dashboards.md) and toggle mode from **Viewing** to **Editing**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-parameters/edit-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Dashboard's homepage." lightbox="media/dashboard-explore-data/dashboards.png":::

1. Select the **Share** menu item in the top bar of the dashboard.
1. Select **Manage access** from the dropdown.

## Grant access

Access can be granted to users [within your tenant](#grant-access-to-users-within-your-tenant) or to [users in a different tenant](#grant-access-to-users-in-a-different-tenant).

### Grant access to users within your tenant

In the **Manage access** pane:

1. Enter the Microsoft Entra user or Microsoft Entra group in **Add new members**.
1. In the **Permission** level, select one of the following values: **Can view** or **Can edit**.
1. Select **Add**.

### Grant access to users in a different tenant

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cross-tenant sharing is disabled by default. To enable cross-tenant sharing, a tenant admin must enable it in the Azure Data Explorer WebUI [settings](web-customize-settings.md#enable-cross-tenant-dashboard-sharing).
>
> If a tenant admin enables cross-tenant sharing and later disables cross-tenant sharing, all dashboards shared while the feature was active will remain accessible.

In the **Dashboard permissions** pane:

1. Select the **Share** menu item in the top bar of the dashboard.
1. Under **Share with external user**, enter the user's email address.

    > [!NOTE]
    > * You can share with individual Microsoft Entra ID users, security groups, or Microsoft accounts (MSA).
    > * You can't share with distribution groups.

1. Choose if you want to allow the user to edit the dashboard. If so, check the **Allow edit permission** box.

    > [!NOTE]
    > An invitee with edit permissions can share the dashboard with users from their own tenant, or use this invitation flow to to invite users from other tenants.

1. Select **Create invitation**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-explore-data/share-external-user.png" alt-text="Screenshot of sharing an Azure Data Explorer dashboard to an external tenant.":::

1. Send the invitation link to the user. The user must [accept the invitation](#accept-an-invitation) to access the dashboard.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * Once an invitation is sent, it can't be revoked. You can wait until the invitation expires, or you can revoke access once the invitee has accepted the invitation.
> * The lifetime of an invitation is three days. After that, the invitation expires and a user who didn't accept the invitation can't access the dashboard.

After sharing the dashboard, you can see who you've shared with in the **Dashboard permissions** pane.

#### Accept an invitation

When the user clicks on the invitation link, they see a page with the following information:

* The dashboard name
* What to expect when they accept the invitation

The user can then accept the invitation and sign in to access the dashboard.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The user must accept the invitation while signed in to their home tenant.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're accepting on behalf of a security group, you must be a member of the group to accept the invitation. Once the first member of the group accepts the invitation, all members of the group can use the [shared link](#share-the-dashboard-link) to access the dashboard.

## Change a user permission level

To change a user permission level in the **Dashboard permissions** pane:

1. Either use the search box or scroll the user list to find the user.
1. Change the **Permission** level as needed.
1. To remove a user, select the trash icon next to the user.
