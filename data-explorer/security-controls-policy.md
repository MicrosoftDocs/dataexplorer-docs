# Azure Policy Regulatory Compliance controls for Azure Data Explorer

[Regulatory Compliance in Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/concepts/regulatory-compliance)
provides Microsoft created and managed initiative definitions, known as _built-ins_, for the
**compliance domains** and **security controls** related to different compliance standards. This
page lists the **compliance domains** and **security controls** for Azure Data Explorer. You can
assign the built-ins for a **security control** individually to help make your Azure resources
compliant with the specific standard.

The title of each built-in policy definition links to the policy definition in the Azure portal. Use
the link in the **Policy Version** column to view the source on the
[Azure Policy GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy).

For resources regarding compliance for your business or organization, see the [Azure compliance documentation](/azure/compliance).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each control below is associated with one or more
> [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview) definitions. These policies may help you
> [assess compliance](/azure/governance/policy/how-to/get-compliance-data) with the control;
> however, there often is not a one-to-one or complete match between a control and one or more
> policies. As such, **Compliant** in Azure Policy refers only to the policies themselves; this
> doesn't ensure you're fully compliant with all requirements of a control. In addition, the
> compliance standard includes controls that aren't addressed by any Azure Policy definitions at
> this time. Therefore, compliance in Azure Policy is only a partial view of your overall compliance
> status. The associations between controls and Azure Policy Regulatory Compliance definitions for
> these compliance standards may change over time.

## CMMC Level 3
