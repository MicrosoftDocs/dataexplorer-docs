# Queue blobs for ingestion using managed identity authentication

When queuing blobs for ingestion from your own storage accounts, you can use managed identities as an alternative to [shared access signature (SAS)](/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) tokens and [Shared Keys](/rest/api/storageservices/authorize-with-shared-key) authentication methods. Managed identities are a more secure way to ingest data as they don't require you to share your customer SAS tokens or shared keys with the service. Instead, a managed identity is assigned to your cluster and is granted read permissions for the storage account used to ingest data. You can revoke these permissions at any time.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * This authentication method only applies to Azure blobs and Azure Data Lake files residing in customer owned storage accounts. It does not apply to local files uploaded using the Kusto SDK.
> * Only queued ingestion is supported. Inline ingestion in Kusto Query Language and direct ingestion using SDK APIs are not supported. 


## Assign a managed identity to your cluster

Follow [Managed identities overview](managed-identities-overview.md) to add a System or User Assigned managed identity to your cluster.
If your cluster already has the desired managed identity assigned to it, copy its object ID using the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) using an account associated with the Azure subscription that contains your cluster.

1. Navigate to your cluster and select **Identity**.
1. Select the appropriate identity type, system or user assigned, and then copy the object ID of the required identity.

## Grant permissions to the managed identity

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the storage account that contains the data you want to ingest.

1. Select **Access Control** and then select **+ Add** > **Add Role Assignment**.
1. Grant the managed identity **Storage Blob Data Reader**, or **Storage Blob Data Contributor** if you intend to use the **DeleteSourceOnSuccess** source option, permissions to the storage account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Granting **Owner** or **Contributor** permissions is not sufficient and will result in the ingestion failing.

## Set the managed identity policy in Azure Data Explorer

In order to use the managed identity to ingest data into your cluster, allow the `NativeIngestion` usage option for the selected managed identity. Native ingestion refers to the ability to use an SDK for ingestion from an external source. For more information on the available SDKs, see [Client libraries](kusto/api/client-libraries.md).

The usage Managed Identity policy can be defined at the cluster or database level of the target cluster.

To apply the policy at the database level, run the following command:

```kusto
.alter-merge database <database name> policy managed_identity "[ { 'ObjectId' : '<managed_identity_id>', 'AllowedUsages' : 'NativeIngestion' }]"
```

To apply the policy at the cluster level, run the following command:

```kusto
.alter-merge cluster policy managed_identity "[ { 'ObjectId' : '<managed_identity_id>', 'AllowedUsages' : 'NativeIngestion' }]"
```

Replace `<managed_identity_id>` with the object ID of the required managed identity.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have the `All Database Admin` permission on the cluster to edit the Managed Identity Policy.

## Queue blobs for ingestion with managed identity using Kusto SDK

When ingesting data using a Kusto [SDK](net-sdk-ingest-data.md), generate your [blob URI using managed identity authentication](kusto/api/connection-strings/storage-authentication-methods.md#managed-identity) by appending `;managed_identity={objectId}` to the unauthorized blob URI. If you ingest data using your cluster's system assigned managed identity, you can append `;managed_identity=system` to the blob URI.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> You must use a queued ingestion client. 
> Using managed identities with direct ingestion or inline ingestion in Kusto Query Language are not supported.

The following are examples of blob URIs for system and user assigned managed identities.

* System assigned: `https://demosa.blob.core.windows.net/test/export.csv;managed_identity=system`
* User assigned: `https://demosa.blob.core.windows.net/test/export.csv;managed_identity=6a5820b9-fdf6-4cc4-81b9-b416b444fd6d`

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> * When using Managed Identities to ingest data with the C# SDK, you must provide a blob size in `StorageSourceOptions`. If the size is not set, the SDK attempts to fill in the blob size by accessing the storage account, resulting in a failure.
> * The *size* parameter should be the raw (uncompressed) data size, and not the blob size.
> * If you do not know the size at the time of ingestion, specify a value of zero (0). The service will attempt to discover the size using the managed identity for authentication.
