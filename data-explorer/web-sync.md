# Access your Azure Data Explorer web UI data anywhere

This article describes how to sync your Azure Data Explorer web UI profile to the cloud, enabling a consistent experience across devices and browsers. When you sync, your browser's settings, tabs, and connections are stored in the cloud, making them accessible through the [Azure Data Explorer web UI](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/home) from anywhere. Synced data is now associated with your account rather than the specific machine, enabling a consistent experience across devices.

## Prerequisites

* A Microsoft account or a Microsoft Entra user identity. An Azure subscription isn't required.

## Considerations

Before enabling sync, consider the following points:

* The first browser where syncing is enabled becomes the primary data source, overriding data in other browsers.
* Data is account-specific and can't be shared across different user accounts on the same machine.
* Syncing uploads your current device's data to the cloud, replacing local data on other browsers or devices with the cloud-stored version.
* Synced data is stored in your tenant's region. If no Azure region exists in the tenant's region, data is stored in an Azure region in Europe.
* Syncing is irreversible; once enabled:
    * Data is no longer stored exclusively on your device
    * [Exporting and importing](web-customize-settings.md#export-and-import-environment-settings) of your work environment under settings is no longer available

## Sync user profile

To sync your profile data, follow these steps:

1. From the tab bar, select **Sync off**.

1. From the **Sync user profile to cloud** dialog box, select **Turn sync on**.

1. In the **Turn on sync to cloud** dialog box, select **Confirm**.

    >[!CAUTION]
    > Syncing your profile to the cloud is irreversible. Once you confirm, your data is stored in the cloud and no longer on your device.

1. In the tab bar, verify that the status shows **Sync on**. Additionally, ensure that the **Sync on** status shows on other browsers or devices when signed into the same account.
