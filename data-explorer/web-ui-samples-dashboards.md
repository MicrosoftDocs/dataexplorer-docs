# Quickstart: Visualize sample data dashboards

The Azure Data Explorer web UI has a samples gallery for you to view built-in dashboards without the need to [create your own cluster and database](start-for-free-web-ui.md) or [ingest data](ingest-data-overview.md). Dashboards allow you to manipulate different parameters and visuals to gain insights from your data.

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to access and explore the built-in dashboards in the Azure Data Explorer web UI samples gallery. Knowledge of [Kusto Query Language (KQL)](kusto/query/index.md) isn't required to create and modify your dashboards but can be used for further customization.

## Prerequisites

A Microsoft account or a Microsoft Entra user identity to sign in to the [**help** cluster](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/help). An Azure subscription isn't required.

## Explore sample dashboards

1. Sign in to the [Azure Data Explorer web UI](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/home) using your Microsoft account or Microsoft Entra user identity.

1. In the **Home** page, select **Explore sample dashboards**.

1. In the **Explore sample dashboards** dialog box, choose a sample dashboard and then select **Explore**. In keeping with the previous example, select the **Metrics sample dashboard**.
