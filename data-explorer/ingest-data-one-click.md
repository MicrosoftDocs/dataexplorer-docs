# What is one-click ingestion?

One-click ingestion makes the data ingestion process easy, fast, and intuitive. One-click ingestion helps you ramp-up quickly to start ingesting data, creating database tables, mapping structures. Select data from different kinds of sources in different data formats, either as a one-time or continuous ingestion process.

The following features make one-click ingestion so useful:

* Intuitive experience guided by the ingestion wizard
* Ingest data in a matter of minutes
* Ingest data from different kinds of sources: local file, blobs, and containers (up to 10,000 blobs)
* Ingest data in a variety of [formats](#file-formats)
* Ingest data into new or existing tables
* Table mapping and schema are suggested to you and easy to change
* Continue ingestion easily and quickly from a container with [Event Grid](one-click-ingestion-new-table.md#create-continuous-ingestion-for-container)

One-click ingestion is particularly useful when ingesting data for the first time, or when your data's schema is unfamiliar to you.

## Prerequisites

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* Create [an Azure Data Explorer cluster and database](create-cluster-database-portal.md).
* Sign in to the [Azure Data Explorer Web UI](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/) and [add a connection to your cluster](web-query-data.md#add-clusters).

## Access the one-click wizard

The one-click ingestion wizard guides you through the one-click ingestion process.

* To access the one-click ingestion wizard from the **Welcome to Azure Data Explorer** home screen in your cluster, complete the first two steps ([cluster creation and database creation](#prerequisites)) and then select **Ingest new data**.

* To access the wizard from the [Azure Data Explorer web UI](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/), right-click the **database** or **table** row in the left menu of the Azure Data Explorer web UI and select **Ingest new data**.

* To access the wizard from the Azure portal, select **Query** from the left menu, right-click on the **database** or **table**, and select **Ingest new data**.

## One-click ingestion wizard

> [!NOTE]
> This section describes the wizard in general. The options you select depend on what data format you are ingesting, what kind of data source you are ingesting from, and whether you are ingesting into a new or existing table.
>
> For sample scenarios, see:
> * Ingest into [a new table from a container in CSV format](one-click-ingestion-new-table.md)
> * Ingest into an [existing table from a local file in JSON format](one-click-ingestion-existing-table.md) 

The wizard guides you through the following options:
   * Ingest into an [existing table](one-click-ingestion-existing-table.md)
   * Ingest into [a new table](one-click-ingestion-new-table.md)
   * Ingest data from:
      * Blob storage
      * [A local file](one-click-ingestion-existing-table.md)
      * [A container](one-click-ingestion-new-table.md) (blob container, ADLS Gen1 container, ADLS Gen2 container)

### Schema mapping

The service automatically generates schema and ingestion properties, which you can change. You can use an existing mapping structure or create a new one, depending on if you're ingesting to a new or existing table.

In the **Schema** tab, do the following actions:
   * Confirm the autogenerated compression type.
   * Choose the [format of your data](#file-formats). Different formats will allow you to make further changes.
   * Change mapping in the [Editor window](#editor-window).

#### File formats

One-click ingestion supports ingesting from source data in all [data formats supported by Azure Data Explorer for ingestion](ingestion-supported-formats.md).

### Editor window

In the **Editor** window of the **Schema** tab, you can adjust data table columns as necessary. 

[!INCLUDE [data-explorer-one-click-column-table](includes/data-explorer-one-click-column-table.md)]

>[!NOTE]
> At any time, you can open the [command editor](one-click-ingestion-new-table.md#command-editor) above the **Editor** pane. In the command editor, you can view and copy the automatic commands generated from your inputs.

#### Mapping transformations

Some data format mappings (Parquet, JSON, and Avro) support simple ingest-time transformations. To apply mapping transformations, create or update a column in the [Editor window](#editor-window).

Mapping transformations can be performed on a column of **Type** string or datetime, with the **Source** having data type int or long. Supported mapping transformations are:
* DateTimeFromUnixSeconds
* DateTimeFromUnixMilliseconds
* DateTimeFromUnixMicroseconds
* DateTimeFromUnixNanoseconds

For more information, see [mapping transformations](#mapping-transformations).

### Data ingestion

Once you have completed schema mapping and column manipulations, the ingestion wizard will start the data ingestion process. 

* When ingesting data from **non-container** sources, the ingestion will take immediate effect.

* If your data source is a **container**:
    * Azure Data Explorer's [batching policy](kusto/management/batchingpolicy.md) will aggregate your data. 
    * After ingestion, you can download the ingestion report and review the performance of each blob that was addressed. 
    * You can select **Create continuous ingestion** and set up [continuous ingestion using Event Grid](one-click-ingestion-new-table.md#create-continuous-ingestion-for-container).
 
### Initial data exploration
   
After ingestion, the wizard gives you options to use **[Quick commands](one-click-ingestion-existing-table.md#explore-quick-queries-and-tools)** for initial exploration of your data.
