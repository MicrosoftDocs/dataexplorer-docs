# Troubleshoot private endpoints

This guide can help you troubleshoot connectivity, operational, and cluster creation issues for a cluster using private endpoints. If you're experiencing connectivity issues to private endpoints, use the following troubleshooting guidance.

## Check the connection state

Make sure that the private endpoint's connection state is set to approved.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your cluster and then select **Networking**

1. Select **Private endpoint**. In the table, in the **Connection state** column, verify that the private endpoint is approved.

## Run checks from within the virtual network

Use the following checks to investigate connectivity issues from within the same virtual network. We recommended deploying a virtual machine in the same virtual network where you created the private endpoint. Once you logged into the machine, you can run the following tests.

### Check name resolution

Make sure that the name resolution is working properly.

Iterate over all FQDNs of the private endpoint DNS configuration and run the tests using *nslookup*, *Test-NetConnection*, or other similar tools to verify that each DNS matches its corresponding IP address.

### Check DNS resolution

In addition, run the following command to verify that the DNS name of each FQDN matches its corresponding IP address.

```bash
#replace the <...> placeholders with the correct values
nslookup <cluster-name>.<cluster-region>.kusto.windows.net

#Results in the following output:
Server:'Server'
Address:'Address'

Non-authoritative answer:
<cluster-name>.<cluster-region>.kusto.windows.netcanonical name = <cluster-name>.privatelink.<cluster-region>.kusto.windows.net.
Name:<cluster-name>.privatelink.<cluster-region>.kusto.windows.net
Address: 'Address'
```

If you find an FQDN that doesn't match its corresponding IP address, you need to fix your custom DNS server. If you aren't using a custom DNS server, create a support ticket.

### Connectivity checks

Check if you can establish a TCP connection every FQDN of the private endpoint DNS. Run the following tests on all FQDNs mentioned in the DNS configuration of the private endpoint.

```Powershell
#replace the <...> placeholders with the correct values
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <cluster-name>.<cluster-region>.kusto.windows.net -Port 443

#Results in the following output:
ComputerName     : <cluster-name>.<cluster-region>.kusto.windows.net
RemoteAddress    : 'RemoteAddress'
RemotePort       : 443
InterfaceAlias   : Ethernet
SourceAddress    : 'SourceAddress'
TcpTestSucceeded : True
```

A successful result returns **TcpTestSucceeded : True**, which means that the caller was able to establish a TCP connection to the cluster.

### Check the health of the cluster

The last step of the troubleshooting is to test the health of the cluster.

```Powershell
#replace the <...> placeholders with the correct values
#engine
Invoke-RestMethod https://<cluster-name>.<cluster-region>.kusto.windows.net/v1/rest/ping
Pong! IP address: 'IPv6IPaddress1'

#data management
Invoke-RestMethod https://ingest-<cluster-name>.<cluster-region>.kusto.windows.net/v1/rest/ping
Pong! IP address: 'IPv6IPaddress2'
```

A successful result must return **Pong!** and an IPv6 address.

### Check Remote Cretificate Revocation List 

If you get an exception saying the remote certificate can not be validated when using the C# SDK, your network may be configured to block checking the remote certificate revocation list.

```
System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: The SSL connection could not be established, see inner exception. --->
System.Security.Authentication.AuthenticationException: The remote certificate is invalid because of errors in the certificate chain: RevocationStatusUnknown
```

You can reolve this issue by allowing access the [list of remote certificatre verification uris](/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-configure-connectors#allow-access-to-urls) from the [azure private network configuration guide](/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-configure-connectors).

Alternatively (less recommanded), you can disable the remote certificate revocation validation using one of the following options:

* Using Command Line Args: Add the following arguemnt to your C# process:

```
-tweaks:Kusto.Cloud.Platform.Net.ExtendedServicePointManager.DisableCertificateRevocationListValidation=true
```

* Using Environment Variables: set the following environment variable in the context of your machine process:

```
tweaks="Kusto.Cloud.Platform.Net.ExtendedServicePointManager.DisableCertificateRevocationListValidation=true"
````

* Using Code: Add the following line of code when initializing your application:

```csharp
Kusto.Cloud.Platform.Utils.Anchor.Tweaks.SetProgrammaticAppSwitch("Kusto.Cloud.Platform.Net.ExtendedServicePointManager.DisableCertificateRevocationListValidation", "true");
```

### Other troubleshooting tips

If after trying all these checks you're still experiencing an issue, try using the [private endpoint troubleshooting guide](/azure/private-link/troubleshoot-private-endpoint-connectivity#diagnose-connectivity-problems) to diagnose it.

## Troubleshoot managed private endpoints

For managed private endpoints, the only check you can do it to verify that the connection status of all managed private endpoint is **Approved**. Otherwise, the cluster won't be able to connect to the corresponding services.

To verify that the managed private endpoint's connection state is set to approved, do the following:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your cluster and then select **Networking**

1. Select **Private endpoint connections**. In the table, in the **Connection state** column, verify that the managed private endpoint is approved.

If you are unable to create a managed private endpoint, make sure the subscription is registered for the *Microsoft.Network* [resource provider](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider-1):

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your subscription and then select **Resource Providers**

1. Search for *Microsoft.Network* and register the resource provider.

## Other troubleshooting guidelines

If all the checks were successful and you still aren't able to establish a connection to the cluster, then you should contact your corporate security team that is responsible for firewalls and networking in general.

Potential reasons for failure include:

* Misconfiguration of the firewall appliance
* Misconfiguration of User Defined Routes in your Azure Virtual Network
* A misconfigured proxy on the client machine
* A misconfigured proxy between the client and the cluster
