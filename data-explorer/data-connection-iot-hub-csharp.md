In this article, you create an IoT Hub data connection for Azure Data Explorer by using C#.

## Prerequisites

* If you don't have Visual Studio 2019 installed, you can download and use the **free** [Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). Make sure that you enable **Azure development** during the Visual Studio setup.
* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* Create [a cluster and database](create-cluster-database-csharp.md)
* Create [table and column mapping](net-standard-ingest-data.md#create-a-table-on-your-test-cluster)
* Set [database and table policies](database-table-policies-csharp.md) (optional)
* Create an [IoT Hub with a shared access policy configured](ingest-data-iot-hub.md#create-an-iot-hub).

## Add an IoT Hub data connection 

The following example shows you how to add an IoT Hub data connection programmatically. See [connect Azure Data Explorer table to IoT Hub](ingest-data-iot-hub.md#connect-azure-data-explorer-table-to-iot-hub) for adding an Iot Hub data connection using the Azure portal.

```csharp
var tenantId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx";//Directory (tenant) ID
var clientId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx";//Application ID
var clientSecret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx";//Client Secret
var subscriptionId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx";
var authenticationContext = new AuthenticationContext($"https://login.windows.net/{tenantId}");
var credential = new ClientCredential(clientId, clientSecret);
var result = await authenticationContext.AcquireTokenAsync(resource: "https://management.core.windows.net/", clientCredential: credential);

var credentials = new TokenCredentials(result.AccessToken, result.AccessTokenType);

var kustoManagementClient = new KustoManagementClient(credentials)
{
    SubscriptionId = subscriptionId
};

var resourceGroupName = "testrg";
//The cluster and database that are created as part of the Prerequisites
var clusterName = "mykustocluster";
var databaseName = "mykustodatabase";
var dataConnectionName = "myeventhubconnect";
//The IoT hub that is created as part of the Prerequisites
var iotHubResourceId = "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/xxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs/xxxxxx";
var sharedAccessPolicyName = "iothubforread";
var consumerGroup = "$Default";
var location = "Central US";
//The table and column mapping are created as part of the Prerequisites
var tableName = "StormEvents";
var mappingRuleName = "StormEvents_CSV_Mapping";
var dataFormat = DataFormat.CSV;

await kustoManagementClient.DataConnections.CreateOrUpdate(resourceGroupName, clusterName, databaseName, dataConnectionName,
            new IotHubDataConnection(iotHubResourceId, consumerGroup, sharedAccessPolicyName, tableName: tableName, location: location, mappingRuleName: mappingRuleName, dataFormat: dataFormat));
```

|**Setting** | **Suggested value** | **Field description**|
|---|---|---|
| tenantId | *xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx* | Your tenant ID. Also known as directory ID.|
| subscriptionId | *xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx* | The subscription ID that you use for resource creation.|
| clientId | *xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx* | The client ID of the application that can access resources in your tenant.|
| clientSecret | *xxxxxxxxxxxxxx* | The client secret of the application that can access resources in your tenant. |
| resourceGroupName | *testrg* | The name of the resource group containing your cluster.|
