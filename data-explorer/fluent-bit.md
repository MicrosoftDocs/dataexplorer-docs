# Ingest data with Fluent Bit into Azure Data Explorer

[Fluent Bit](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/tree/master) is an open-source agent that collects logs, metrics, and traces from various sources. It allows you to filter, modify, and aggregate event data before sending it to storage. Azure Data Explorer is a fast and highly scalable data exploration service for log and telemetry data. This article guides you through the process of using Fluent Bit to send data to Azure Data Explorer.

In this article, you'll learn how to:

For a complete list of data connectors, see [Data connectors overview](connector-overview.md).

## Prerequisites

* [Fluent Bit](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/installation/getting-started-with-fluent-bit).
* An Azure Data Explorer cluster and database. [Create a cluster and database](create-cluster-and-database.md).

You can use any of the available [Query tools](integrate-query-overview.md) for your query environment.

## Configure Fluent Bit to send logs to your table

To configure Fluent Bit to send logs to your Azure Data Explorer table, create a [classic mode](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/configuring-fluent-bit/classic-mode/configuration-file) or [YAML mode](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/configuring-fluent-bit/yaml/configuration-file) configuration file with the following output properties:
