# Copy data to Azure Data Explorer by using Azure Data Factory

[!INCLUDE [real-time-analytics-connectors-note](includes/real-time-analytics-connectors-note.md)]

Azure Data Explorer is a fast, fully managed, data-analytics service. It offers real-time analysis on large volumes of data that stream from many sources, such as applications, websites, and IoT devices. With Azure Data Explorer, you can iteratively explore data and identify patterns and anomalies to improve products, enhance customer experiences, monitor devices, and boost operations. It helps you explore new questions and get answers in minutes.

Azure Data Factory is a fully managed, cloud-based, data-integration service. You can use it to populate your Azure Data Explorer database with data from your existing system. It can help you save time when you're building analytics solutions.

When you load data into Azure Data Explorer, Data Factory provides the following benefits:

* **Easy setup**: Get an intuitive, five-step wizard with no scripting required.
* **Rich data store support**: Get built-in support for a rich set of on-premises and cloud-based data stores. For a detailed list, see the table of [Supported data stores](/azure/data-factory/copy-activity-overview#supported-data-stores-and-formats).
* **Secure and compliant**: Data is transferred over HTTPS or Azure ExpressRoute. The global service presence ensures that your data never leaves the geographical boundary.
* **High performance**: The data-loading speed is up to 1 gigabyte per second (GBps) into Azure Data Explorer. For more information, see [Copy activity performance](/azure/data-factory/copy-activity-performance).

In this article, you use the Data Factory Copy Data tool to load data from Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) into Azure Data Explorer. You can follow a similar process to copy data from other data stores, such as:
* [Azure Blob storage](/azure/data-factory/connector-azure-blob-storage)
* [Azure SQL Database](/azure/data-factory/connector-azure-sql-database)
* [Azure SQL Data Warehouse](/azure/data-factory/connector-azure-sql-data-warehouse)
* [Google BigQuery](/azure/data-factory/connector-google-bigquery)
* [Oracle](/azure/data-factory/connector-oracle)
* [File system](/azure/data-factory/connector-file-system)

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. Create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* An Azure Data Explorer cluster and database. [Create a cluster and database](create-cluster-and-database.md).

    ![The Azure Data Explorer New Linked Service pane.](media/data-factory-load-data/adx-new-linked-service.png)

   1. In the **Name** box, enter a name for the Azure Data Explorer linked service.
   1. Under **Authentication method**, choose **System Assigned Managed Identity** or **Service Principal**.

        * To Authenticate using a Managed Identity, grant the Managed Identity access to the database by using the **Managed identity name** or **Managed identity object ID**.
        * To Authenticate using a Service Principal:

            1. In the **Tenant** box, enter the tenant name.
            1. In the **Service principal ID** box, enter the service principal ID.
            1. Select **Service principal key** and then, in the **Service principal key** box, enter the value for the key.

        > [!NOTE]
        > * The service principal is used by Azure Data Factory to access the Azure Data Explorer service. To create a service principal, go to [create a Microsoft Entra service principal](/azure-stack/operator/azure-stack-create-service-principals#manage-an-azure-ad-service-principal).
        > * To assign permissions to a Managed Identity or a Service Principal or , see [manage permissions](manage-database-permissions.md).
        > * Do not use the Azure Key Vault method or User Assigned Managed Identity.

   1. Under **Account selection method**, choose one of the following options:

        * Select **From Azure subscription** and then, in the drop-down lists, select your **Azure subscription** and your **Cluster**.

            > [!NOTE]
            > * The **Cluster** drop-down control lists only clusters that are associated with your subscription.
            > * Your cluster must have the appropriate [SKU](manage-cluster-choose-sku.md) for [best performance](data-factory-integration.md#performance).

        * Select **Enter manually**, and then enter your **Endpoint**.

   1. In the **Database** drop-down list, select your database name. Alternatively, select the **Edit** check box, and then enter the database name.
   1. To test the linked service connection you created, select **Test Connection**. If you can connect to your linked service, the pane displays a green checkmark and a **Connection successful** message.
   1. Select **Create** to complete the linked service creation.

#### Configure the Azure Data Explorer data connection

After you've created the linked service connection, the **Destination data store** pane opens, and the connection you created is available for use. To configure the connection, do the following steps:

1. Select **Next**.

    ![The Azure Data Explorer "Destination data store" pane](media/data-factory-load-data/destination-data-store.png)

1. In the **Table mapping** pane, set the destination table name, and then select **Next**.

    ![The destination dataset "Table mapping" pane](media/data-factory-load-data/destination-dataset-table-mapping.png)

1. In the **Column mapping** pane, the following mappings take place:

    a. The first mapping is performed by Azure Data Factory according to the [Azure Data Factory schema mapping](/azure/data-factory/copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping). Do the following:

    * Set the **Column mappings** for the Azure Data Factory destination table. The default mapping is displayed from source to the Azure Data Factory destination table.

    * Cancel the selection of the columns that you don't need to define your column mapping.

    b. The second mapping occurs when this tabular data is ingested into Azure Data Explorer. Mapping is performed according to [CSV mapping rules](kusto/management/csv-mapping.md). Even if the source data isn't in CSV format, Azure Data Factory converts the data into a tabular format. Therefore, CSV mapping is the only relevant mapping at this stage. Do the following:

    * (Optional) Under **Azure Data Explorer (Kusto) sink properties**, add the relevant **Ingestion mapping name** so that column mapping can be used.

    * If **Ingestion mapping name** isn't specified, the *by-name* mapping order that's defined in the **Column mappings** section will be used. If *by-name* mapping fails, Azure Data Explorer tries to ingest the data in a *by-column position* order (that is, it maps by  position as the default).

    * Select **Next**.

    ![The destination dataset "Column mapping" pane](media/data-factory-load-data/destination-dataset-column-mapping.png)

1. In the **Settings** pane, do the following steps:

    a. Under **Fault tolerance settings**, enter the relevant settings.

    b. Under **Performance settings**, **Enable staging** doesn't apply, and **Advanced settings** includes cost considerations. If you have no specific requirements, leave these settings as is.

    c. Select **Next**.

    ![The copy data "Settings" pane](media/data-factory-load-data/copy-data-settings.png)

1. In the **Summary** pane, review the settings, and then select **Next**.

    ![The copy data "Summary" pane](media/data-factory-load-data/copy-data-summary.png)

1. In the **Deployment complete** pane, do the following:

    a. To switch to the **Monitor** tab and view the status of the pipeline (that is, progress, errors, and data flow), select **Monitor**.

    b. To edit linked services, datasets, and pipelines, select **Edit Pipeline**.

    c. Select **Finish** to complete the copy data task.
