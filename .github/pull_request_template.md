## For internal Microsoft contributors, check off these quality control items as you go

- [ ] 1. **Check the Acrolinx report:** Make sure your Acrolinx Total score is **above 80 minimum** (higher is better) and with no spelling issues. Acrolinx ensures we are providing consistent terminology and using an appropriate voice and tone, and helps with localization.

- [ ] 2. **Successful build with no warnings or suggestions**: Review the build status to make sure **all files are green** (Succeeded).

- [ ] 3. **Preview the pages:**: Click each **Preview URL** link to view the rendered HTML pages on the review.learn.microsoft.com site to check the formatting and alignment of the page. Scan the page for overall formatting, and look at the parts you edited in detail.

- [ ] 4. **Check the Table of Contents:** If you are adding a new markdown file, make sure it is linked from the table of contents.

- [ ] 5. **#sign-off to request PR review and merge**: Once the pull request is finalized and ready to be merged, indicate so by typing `#sign-off` in a new comment in the Pull Request. If you need to cancel that sign-off, type `#hold-off` instead. *Signing off means the document can be published at any time.* Note, this is a formatting and standards review, not a technical review.

## Merge and publish

- After you `#sign-off`, there is a separate PR Review team that will review the PR and describe any necessary feedback before merging. 
- The review team will use the comments section in the PR to provide feedback if changes are needed. Address any blocking issues and sign off again to request another review.
- Once all feedback is resolved, you can `#sign-off` again. The PR Review team reviews and merges the pull request into the specified branch (usually the *main( branch or a *release-branch*).
- From the *main* branch, the change is merged into the *live* branch several times a day to publish it to the public learn.microsoft.com site.
