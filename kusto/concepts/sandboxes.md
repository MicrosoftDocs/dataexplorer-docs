# Sandboxes

> [!INCLUDE [applies](../includes/applies-to-version/applies.md)] [!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer](../includes/applies-to-version/azure-data-explorer.md)]

Kusto can run sandboxes for specific flows that must be run in a secure and isolated environment.
Examples of these flows are user-defined scripts that run using the [Python plugin](../query/python-plugin.md) or the [R plugin](../query/r-plugin.md).

Sandboxes are run locally (meaning, processing is done close to the data), with no extra latency for remote calls.

## Prerequisites and limitations

* Sandboxes that run on [VM sizes supporting nested virtualization](#vm-sizes-supporting-nested-virtualization) are implemented using [Hyper-V technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-V) and have no limitations.
* Sandboxes that run on [VM sizes not supporting nested virtualization](sandboxes-in-non-modern-skus.md#virtual-machine-sizes) are implemented using a proprietary legacy technology and are subject to [some limitations](sandboxes-in-non-modern-skus.md).
* The image for running the sandboxes is deployed to every cluster node and requires dedicated SSD space to run.
  * The estimated size is between 10-20 GB.
  * This affects the cluster's data capacity, and may affect the [cost](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/data-explorer) of the cluster.

## Runtime

* A sandboxed query operator may use one or more sandboxes for its execution.
  * A sandbox is only used for a single query and is disposed of once that query completes.
  * When a node is restarted, for example, as part of a service upgrade, all running sandboxes on it are disposed of.
* Each node maintains a predefined number of sandboxes that are ready for running incoming requests.
  * Once a sandbox is used, a new one is automatically made available to replace it.
* If there are no pre-allocated sandboxes available to serve a query operator, it will be throttled until new sandboxes are available. For more information, see [Errors](#errors). New sandbox allocation could take up to 10-15 seconds per sandbox, depending on the SKU and available resources on the data node.

## Sandbox parameters

Some of the  parameters can be controlled using a cluster-level [sandbox policy](../management/sandbox-policy.md), for each kind of sandbox.

* **Number of sandboxes per node:** The number of sandboxes per node is limited.
  * Requests that are made when there's no available sandbox will be throttled.
* **Initialize on startup:** if set to `false` (default), sandboxes are lazily initialized on a node, the first time a query requires a sandbox for its execution. Otherwise, if set to `true`, sandboxes are initialized as part of service startup.
  * This means that the first execution of a plugin that uses sandboxes on a node will include a short warm-up period.
* **CPU:** The maximum rate of CPU a sandbox can consume of its host's processors is limited (default is `50%`).
  * When the limit is reached, the sandbox's CPU use is throttled, but execution continues.
* **Memory:** The maximum amount of RAM a sandbox can consume of its host's RAM is limited.
  * Default memory for Hyper-V technology is 1 GB, and for legacy sandboxes 20 GB.
  * Reaching the limit results in termination of the sandbox, and a query execution error.

## Sandbox limitations

* **Network:** A sandbox can't interact with any resource on the virtual machine (VM) or outside of it.
  * A sandbox can't interact with another sandbox.

> [!NOTE]
> The resources used with sandbox depend not only on the size of the data being processed as part of the request,
> but also on the logic that runs in the sandbox, and the implementation of libraries being used by it.
> For example, for the `python` and `r` plugins, the latter means the user-provided script and the Python or R libraries it consumes at runtime.
