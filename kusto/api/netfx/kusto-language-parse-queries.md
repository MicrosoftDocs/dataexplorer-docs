# Parse queries and commands with Kusto.Language

> [!INCLUDE [applies](../../includes/applies-to-version/applies.md)] [!INCLUDE [fabric](../../includes/applies-to-version/fabric.md)] [!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer](../../includes/applies-to-version/azure-data-explorer.md)]

With [Kusto.Language](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Kusto.Language/), you can parse queries and management commands to generate a structured syntax tree. This article outlines the fundamental concepts and methods needed to parse queries with Kusto.Language.

## Overview of Kusto.Language methods

The following table overviews the main methods used in this article.

|Goal|Method|
|--|--|
|Parse a query or command|`KustoCode.Parse(`*query*`)`|
|Parse a query or command with semantic analysis|`KustoCode.ParseAndAnalyze(`*query*`,` *globals*`)`|

The following table overviews additional actions that can be taken once a query has been parsed. `code` is the returned value from the previously described methods, meaning it is a parsed `KustoCode` instance.

:::moniker range="azure-data-explorer"

|Goal|Method|Notes|
|--|--|--|
|Find the table for a column|`code.Globals.GetTable(`*column*`)`|Only relevant for semantic analysis (`ParseAndAnalyze`).|
|Find the database for a table|`code.Globals.GetDatabase(`*table*`)`|Only relevant for semantic analysis (`ParseAndAnalyze`).|
|Find the cluster for a database|`code.Globals.GetCluster(`*database*`)`|Only relevant for semantic analysis (`ParseAndAnalyze`).|
|Get diagnostic information like errors and warnings|`code.GetDiagnostics()`|`Parse` provides syntax-related diagnostic information, while `ParseAndAnalyze` provides diagnostic information for both syntax and semantics.|

## Parse a query

The following steps provide an example of how to parse and navigate a parsed query.

1. Provide your query as an argument to the `KustoCode.Parse` method as a string. The following example returns a `KustoCode` instance that contains the parsed syntax tree.

    ```csharp
    var query = "T | project a = a + b | where a > 10.0";
    var code = KustoCode.Parse(query);
    ```

1. Navigate the tree using various APIs, such as `GetDescendants`, `GetAncestors`, `GetChild`, `Parent`, `WalkNodes`, `GetTokenAt`, or `GetNodeAt`. The following example finds all the places where the name `a` was referenced.

    ```csharp
    var referencesToA = code.Syntax.GetDescendants<NameReference>(n => n.SimpleName == "a");
    Assert.AreEqual(2, referencesToA.Count);
    ```

## Parse a query with semantic analysis

Semantic analysis allows you to identify the exact columns, variables, functions, or tables associated with different parts of the query syntax.

In the previous section, there wasn't a distinction made between the column `a` declared by the `project` operator and the column `a` that originally existed in the table. In order to correctly distinguish between the two, have the parser perform semantic analysis.

The following steps provide an example of how to perform semantic analysis with the parser.

1. [Define schemas](kusto-language-define-schemas.md) for the entities referenced in your queries.

    ```csharp
    var globals = GlobalState.Default.WithDatabase(
        new DatabaseSymbol("db",
            new TableSymbol("T", "(a: real, b: real)")
        )
    );
    ```

1. Use the `KustoCode.ParseAndAnalyze` method with the globals that contain the relevant entity schemas.

    ```csharp
    var query = "T | project a = a + b | where a > 10.0";
    var code = KustoCode.ParseAndAnalyze(query, globals);
    ```

1. Navigate the tree and access new properties, such as `ReferencedSymbol` and `ResultType`. The following example uses the ReferencedSymbol property to check how many times the column `a` from the original table was referenced.

    ```csharp
    var columnA = globals.Database.Tables.First(t => t.Name == "T").GetColumn("a");
    var referencesToA = code.Syntax.GetDescendants<NameReference>(n => n.ReferencedSymbol == columnA);
    Assert.AreEqual(1, referencesToA.Count);
    ```

## Check a parsed query for errors

Use the `GetDiagnostics` method to identify syntactic and semantic errors in your queries. For queries that are parsed without semantic analysis, only syntax errors are found.

The following example shows how to parse a query and check it for errors.

```csharp
// Parse a query.
var query = "T | project a = a + b | where a > 10";
var code = KustoCode.Parse(query);

// Check if the query has any syntax errors.
var diagnostics = code.GetDiagnostics();

// Investigate and handle the errors.
if (diagnostics.Count > 0) { ... }
```

> [!NOTE]
> Check the `Severity` property to see if the diagnostic is an error, warning, or another type of diagnostic.
