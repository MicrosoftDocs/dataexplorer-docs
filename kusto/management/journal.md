# Journal management

> [!INCLUDE [applies](../includes/applies-to-version/applies.md)] [!INCLUDE [fabric](../includes/applies-to-version/fabric.md)] [!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer](../includes/applies-to-version/azure-data-explorer.md)]

`Journal` contains information about metadata operations done on your database.

The metadata operations can result from a management command that a user executed, or internal management commands that the system executed, such as drop extents by retention.

> [!NOTE]
> * Metadata operations that encompass *adding* new extents, such as `.ingest`, `.append`, `.move` and others, will not have matching events shown in the `Journal`.
> * The data in the columns of the result-set, as well as the format in which it's presented, isn't contractual. 
  Taking a dependency on them isn't recommended.
