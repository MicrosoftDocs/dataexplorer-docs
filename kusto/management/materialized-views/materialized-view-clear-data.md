# .clear materialized-view data

> [!INCLUDE [applies](../../includes/applies-to-version/applies.md)] [!INCLUDE [fabric](../../includes/applies-to-version/fabric.md)] [!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer](../../includes/applies-to-version/azure-data-explorer.md)]

Clears the data of an existing materialized view.

The data is cleared from the `materialized part` of the view only. For more information about the  `materialized part`, see [how materialized views work](materialized-view-overview.md#how-materialized-views-work). After the materialized view data is cleared, the view will continue processing the source table records ingested since the last materialization time. Use the [`.show materialized-view`](materialized-view-show-command.md#show-materialized-views) command to get the last materialization timestamp.

The difference between this command and dropping and recreating the view (with no `backfill`) is that using this command preserves all policies set on the materialized view.

## Permissions

You must have at least [Materialized View Admin](../../access-control/role-based-access-control.md) permissions to run this command.

## Syntax

`.clear` `materialized-view` *MaterializedViewName* `data`

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

| Name                   | Type   | Required | Description                    |
|------------------------|--------|----------|--------------------------------|
| *MaterializedViewName* | `string` |  :heavy_check_mark:  | Name of the materialized view. |

## Returns

Following is the schema of the output returned:

| TableName         | `string` | Internal name used to refer to the materialized part of the materialized view. It consists of the prefix `_MV_` followed by the name the user assigned to the materialized view when it was created.    |
