## Permissions

You must have at least [Database Admin](../access-control/role-based-access-control.md) permissions to run this command.

## Syntax

`.alter-merge` `materialized-view` *MaterializedViewName* `policy` `merge` *PolicyObject*

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

## Parameters

|Name|Type|Required|Description|
|--|--|--|--|
|*MaterializedViewName*| `string` | :heavy_check_mark:|The name of the materialized view.|
|*PolicyObject*| `string` | :heavy_check_mark:|A serialized array of one or more JSON policy objects. For more information, see [merge policy](merge-policy.md).|

### Example

Change a single property of the policy at the materialized view level, retaining all other properties as before:

~~~kusto
.alter-merge materialized-view [materialized_view_name] policy merge ```
{
    "MaxRangeInHours": 24
}```
