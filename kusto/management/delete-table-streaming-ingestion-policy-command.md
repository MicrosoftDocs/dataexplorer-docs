# .delete table policy streamingingestion command

> [!INCLUDE [applies](../includes/applies-to-version/applies.md)] [!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer](../includes/applies-to-version/azure-data-explorer.md)]

Delete the table streaming ingestion policy. Use the [streaming policy](../management/streaming-ingestion-policy.md) to manage streaming ingestion for databases and tables.  

Streaming ingestion is targeted for scenarios that require low latency, with an ingestion time of less than 10 seconds for varied volume data. It's used to optimize operational processing of many tables, in one or more databases, where the stream of data into each table is relatively small (a few records per second) but the overall data ingestion volume is high (thousands of records per second).

Use the classic (bulk) ingestion instead of streaming ingestion when the amount of data grows to more than 4 Gb per hour per table.

To learn how to implement streaming ingestion, see [streaming ingestion](/azure/data-explorer/ingest-data-streaming.md).
