# .show streamingingestion statistics command

> [!INCLUDE [applies](../includes/applies-to-version/applies.md)] [!INCLUDE [fabric](../includes/applies-to-version/fabric.md)] [!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer](../includes/applies-to-version/azure-data-explorer.md)]

This command returns a result set that includes aggregated statistics for the [streaming ingestion](/azure/data-explorer/ingest-data-streaming.md#choose-the-appropriate-streaming-ingestion-type).

> [!NOTE]
> The streaming ingestion statistics are grouped into buckets of short periods of time and aggregated by database, table, principal, ingestion status, and ingestion properties.
>
> The retention period for streaming ingestion statistics is 14 days.
