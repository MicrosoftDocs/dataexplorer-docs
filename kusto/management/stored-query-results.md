# Stored query results

> [!INCLUDE [applies](../includes/applies-to-version/applies.md)] [!INCLUDE [fabric](../includes/applies-to-version/fabric.md)] [!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer](../includes/applies-to-version/azure-data-explorer.md)]

*Stored query results* store the result of a query on the service for up to 24 hours. The same principal identity that created the stored query can reference the results in later queries.

Stored query results can be useful in the following scenarios:

* Paging through query results. The initial command runs the query and returns the first "page" of records. Later queries reference other "pages" without the need to rerun the query.
* Drill-down scenarios, in which the results of an initial query are then explored using other queries.

Updates to security policies, such as database access and row level security, aren't propagated to stored query results. Use [`.drop stored_query_results`](drop-stored-query-result-command.md) if there's user permission revocation.

Stored query results behave like tables, in that the order of records isn't preserved. To paginate through the results, we recommended that the query includes [unique ID columns](../query/stored-query-result-function.md#pagination). If a query returns multiple result sets, only the first result set is stored.
