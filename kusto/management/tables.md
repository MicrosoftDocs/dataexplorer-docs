| Command syntax                             | Semantics                                                                                                             |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.create entityType entityName ...`        | If an entity of that type and name exists, returns the entity. Otherwise, create the entity.                          |
| `.create-merge entityType entityName...`   | If an entity of that type and name exists, merge the existing entity with the specified entity. Otherwise, create the entity. |
| `.alter entityType entityName ...`         | If an entity of that type and name does not exist, error. Otherwise, replace it with the specified entity.            |
| `.alter-merge entityType entityName ...`   | If an entity of that type and name does not exist, error. Otherwise, merge it with the specified entity.              |
| `.drop entityType entityName ...`          | If an entity of that type and name does not exist, error. Otherwise, drop it.                                         |
| `.drop entityType entityName ifexists ...` | If an entity of that type and name does not exist, return. Otherwise, drop it.                                        |

> [!NOTE]
> "Merge" is a logical merge of two entities:
>
> * If a property is defined for one entity but not the other, it appears with its original value in the merged entity.
> * If a property is defined for both entities and has the same value in both, it appears once with that value in the merged entity.
> * If a property is defined for both entities but has different values, an error is raised.
