Delete a materialized-view's [retention policy](retention-policy.md). The retention policy controls the mechanism that automatically removes data from tables or materialized views. It is used to remove data whose relevance is age-based. The retention policy can be configured for a specific table or materialized view, or for an entire database. The policy then applies to all tables in the database that don't override it.
