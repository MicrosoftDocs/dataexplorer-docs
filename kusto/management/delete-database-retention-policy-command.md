Delete a database's [retention policy](retention-policy.md). The retention policy controls the mechanism that automatically removes data from tables or materialized views. It is used to remove data whose relevance is age-based. The retention policy can be configured for a specific table or materialized view, or for an entire database. The policy then applies to all tables in the database that don't override it.

## Permissions

You must have at least [Database Admin](../access-control/role-based-access-control.md) permissions to run this command.

## Syntax

`.delete` `database` *DatabaseName* `policy` `retention`
