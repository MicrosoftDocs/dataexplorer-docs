# .show database policy sharding command

> [!INCLUDE [applies](../includes/applies-to-version/applies.md)] [!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer](../includes/applies-to-version/azure-data-explorer.md)]

Show the database sharding policy. Use the [sharding policy](../management/sharding-policy.md) to manage data sharding for databases and tables.  

The sharding policy defines if and how [Extents (data shards)](../management/extents-overview.md) in your cluster should be sealed. When a database is created, it contains the default data sharding policy. This policy is inherited by all tables created in the database (unless the policy is explicitly overridden at the table level).

## Permissions

You must have at least Database User, Database Viewer, or Database Monitor permissions to run this command. For more information, see [role-based access control](../access-control/role-based-access-control.md).

## Syntax

`.show` `database` *DatabaseName* `policy` `sharding`

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

## Parameters

|Name|Type|Required|Description|
|--|--|--|--|
|*DatabaseName*| `string` | :heavy_check_mark:|The name of the database.|

## Returns

Returns a JSON representation of the policy.

## Example

The following example shows the table sharding policy:

```kusto
.show database MyDatabase policy sharding 
```
