Display the table's [row order policy](row-order-policy.md). The row order policy is an optional policy set on tables, that suggests the desired ordering of rows in an [extent (data shard)](extents-overview.md). The purpose of the policy is to improve performance of queries that are known to be narrowed to a small subset of values in the ordered columns.
