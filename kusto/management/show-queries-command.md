:::moniker range="azure-data-explorer"
The `.show` `queries` command lists queries on the cluster that have reached a final state, and that the user invoking the command has access to see. Optionally, the command can return queries that are still running, queries by specific users, or queries grouped by user. To see both queries and commands completion, use [.show queries-and-commands](commands-and-queries.md).
