In the absence of an enabled request classification policy, all requests are classified into the `default` workload group.

## Policy object

The policy has the following properties:

* `IsEnabled`: `bool` - Indicates if the policy is enabled or not.
* `ClassificationFunction`: `string` - The body of the function to use for classifying requests.

## Classification function

The classification of incoming requests is based on a user-defined function. The results of the function are used to classify requests into existing workload groups.

The user-defined function has the following characteristics and behaviors:

* If `IsEnabled` is set to `true` in the policy, the user-defined function is evaluated for every new request.
* The user-defined function gives workload group context for the request for the full lifetime of the request.
* The request is given the `default` workload group context in the following situations:
  * The user-defined function returns an empty string, `default`, or the name of non-existent workload group.
  * The function fails for any reason.
* Only one user-defined function can be designated at any given time.

> The request classification function will be evaluated for each request that runs on the cluster.
> It is recommended to keep it as lightweight as possible, and not include heavy computations in it.
> For example, avoid having to evaluate many regular expressions as part of its execution.

### Requirements and limitations

A classification function:

* Must return a single scalar value of type `string`, that is the name of the workload group to assign the request to.
* Must not reference any other entity (database, table, or function).
  * Specifically - it may not use the following functions and operators:
    * `cluster()`
    * `database()`
    * `table()`
    * `external_table()`
    * `externaldata`
* Has access to a special `dynamic` symbol, a property-bag named `request_properties`, with the following properties:

> [!NOTE]
> Setting the aforementioned request options using `set` statements does not allow classification by them. The options need to be set in the client request properties object.

### Examples

#### A single workload group

```kusto
iff(request_properties.current_application == "Kusto.Explorer" and request_properties.request_type == "Query",
    "Ad-hoc queries",
    "default")
```

#### Multiple workload groups

```kusto
case(current_principal_is_member_of('aadgroup=somesecuritygroup@contoso.com'), "First workload group",
     request_properties.current_database == "MyDatabase" and request_properties.current_principal has 'aadapp=', "Second workload group",
     request_properties.current_application == "Kusto.Explorer" and request_properties.request_type == "Query", "Third workload group",
     request_properties.current_application == "Kusto.Explorer", "Third workload group",
     request_properties.current_application == "KustoQueryRunner", "Fourth workload group",
     request_properties.request_description == "this is a test", "Fifth workload group",
     hourofday(now()) between (17 .. 23), "Sixth workload group",
     "default")
```
