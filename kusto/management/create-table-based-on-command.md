> All properties of the source table are copied to the new table, with the following exceptions:
>
> * [Update policy](update-policy.md)
> * [Authorized principals](security-roles.md): When using the `.create table based-on` command, the current principal is added to the table admins.

## Permissions

You must have at least [Database Admin](../access-control/role-based-access-control.md) permissions to run this command.

`.create` `table` *tableName* `based-on` *otherTable*  [`ifnotexists`] [`with` `(`*propertyName* `=` *propertyValue* [`,` ...]`)`]

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |

| `ifnotexists` | `string` | | If specified, the table will only be created if it doesn't already exist.|

## Returns

>   * If `ifnotexists` flag is specified, the command is ignored (no change applied).

## Example

```kusto
.create table MyLogs_Temp based-on MyLogs with (folder="TempTables")
```
