The behavior of KQL may vary when using this language in different services. When you view any KQL documentation article by using our Learn website, the currently chosen service name is visible above the table of contents (TOC) under the **Version** dropdown. Switch between services using the version dropdown to see the KQL behavior for the selected service.

## Change service selection

If you want to see the documentation for a different version of KQL, select the expander arrow located at the end of the current version moniker. Then select any service you want. When you select a different service, the displayed documentation suddenly changes to show the differences for the newly chosen version. There might or might not be any changes, and both cases are common.

## HTTPS parameter view=

Each article whose web address begins with `https://learn.microsoft.com/kusto/` has a parameter named `?view=` appended to its address. This parameter value is the versioning moniker code.

The moniker code in the https address always matches the moniker name that is displayed in the versioning control.

## Applies to services

Most of the KQL articles have the words **Applies to** under their title. On the same line, there follows a handy listing of services with indicators of which services are relevant for this article. For example, a certain function could be applicable to Fabric and Azure Data Explorer, but not Azure Monitor or others. If you do not see the service you are using, most likely the article is not relevant to your service. 

## Versions

The following table describes the different versions of KQL and the services they are associated with.
