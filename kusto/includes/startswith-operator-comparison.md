The following table compares the `startswith` operators using the abbreviations provided:

* RHS = right-hand side of the expression
* LHS = left-hand side of the expression

|Operator   |Description   |Case-Sensitive  |Example (yields `true`)  |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------------|
|[`startswith`](../query/startswith-operator.md) |RHS is an initial subsequence of LHS |No |`"Fabrikam" startswith "fab"`|
|[`!startswith`](../query/not-startswith-operator.md) |RHS isn't an initial subsequence of LHS |No |`"Fabrikam" !startswith "kam"`|
|[`startswith_cs`](../query/startswith-cs-operator.md)  |RHS is an initial subsequence of LHS |Yes |`"Fabrikam" startswith_cs "Fab"`|
|[`!startswith_cs`](../query/not-startswith-cs-operator.md) |RHS isn't an initial subsequence of LHS |Yes |`"Fabrikam" !startswith_cs "fab"`|

For more information about other operators and to determine which operator is most appropriate for your query, see [datatype string operators](../query/datatypes-string-operators.md).
