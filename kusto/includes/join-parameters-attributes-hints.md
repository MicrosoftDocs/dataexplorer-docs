## Parameters

|Name|Type|Required|Description|
|--|--|--|--|
|*LeftTable*| `string` | :heavy_check_mark:|The left table or tabular expression, sometimes called the outer table, whose rows are to be merged. Denoted as `$left`.|
|*Hints*| `string` ||Zero or more space-separated join hints in the form of *Name* `=` *Value* that control the behavior of the row-match operation and execution plan. For more information, see [Hints](#hints).
|*RightTable*| `string` | :heavy_check_mark:|The right table or tabular expression, sometimes called the inner table, whose rows are to be merged. Denoted as `$right`.|
|*Conditions*| `string` | :heavy_check_mark:|Determines how rows from *LeftTable* are matched with rows from *RightTable*. If the columns you want to match have the same name in both tables, use the syntax `ON` *ColumnName*. Otherwise, use the syntax `ON $left.`*LeftColumn* `==` `$right.`*RightColumn*. To specify multiple conditions, you can either use the "and" keyword or separate them with commas. If you use commas, the conditions are evaluated using the "and" logical operator.|

> [!TIP]
> For best performance, if one table is always smaller than the other, use it as the left side of the join.
