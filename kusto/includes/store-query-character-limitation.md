## Character limitation

The command fails if the query generates an entity name with the `$` character. The [entity names](../query/schema-entities/entity-names.md) must comply with the naming rules, so the `$` character must be removed for the ingest command to succeed.

For example, in the following query, the `search` operator generates a column `$table`. To store the query results, use [project-rename](../query/project-rename-operator.md) to rename the column.

```kusto
.set stored_query_result Texas <| search ['State']:'Texas' | project-rename tableName=$table
```
