The following table compares the `endswith` operators using the abbreviations provided:

* RHS = right-hand side of the expression
* LHS = left-hand side of the expression

|Operator   |Description   |Case-Sensitive  |Example (yields `true`)  |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------------|
|[`endswith`](../query/endswith-operator.md) |RHS is a closing subsequence of LHS |No |`"Fabrikam" endswith "Kam"`|
|[`!endswith`](../query/not-endswith-operator.md) |RHS isn't a closing subsequence of LHS |No |`"Fabrikam" !endswith "brik"`|
|[`endswith_cs`](../query/endswith-cs-operator.md) |RHS is a closing subsequence of LHS |Yes |`"Fabrikam" endswith_cs "kam"`|
|[`!endswith_cs`](../query/not-endswith-cs-operator.md) |RHS isn't a closing subsequence of LHS |Yes |`"Fabrikam" !endswith_cs "brik"`|

For more information about other operators and to determine which operator is most appropriate for your query, see [datatype string operators](../query/datatypes-string-operators.md).
