# ago()

> [!INCLUDE [applies](../includes/applies-to-version/applies.md)] [!INCLUDE [fabric](../includes/applies-to-version/fabric.md)] [!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer](../includes/applies-to-version/azure-data-explorer.md)] [!INCLUDE [monitor](../includes/applies-to-version/monitor.md)] [!INCLUDE [sentinel](../includes/applies-to-version/sentinel.md)]

Subtracts the given [timespan](scalar-data-types/timespan.md) from the current UTC time.

Like `now()`, if you use `ago()` multiple times in a single query statement, the current UTC time
being referenced is the same across all uses.

## Syntax

`ago(`*timespan*`)`

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| *timespan* | `timespan` |  :heavy_check_mark: | The interval to subtract from the current UTC clock time `now()`. For a full list of possible timespan values, see [timespan literals](scalar-data-types/timespan.md#timespan-literals).|

## Returns

A [datetime](scalar-data-types/datetime.md) value equal to the current time minus the timespan.

## Example

All rows with a timestamp in the past hour:

```kusto
T | where Timestamp > ago(1h)
```
