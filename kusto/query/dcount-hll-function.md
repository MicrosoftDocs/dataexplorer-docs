Calculates the distinct count from results generated by [hll](hll-aggregation-function.md) or [hll_merge](hll-merge-aggregation-function.md).

Read about the [underlying algorithm (*H*yper*L*og*L*og) and estimation accuracy](#estimation-accuracy).

## Syntax

`dcount_hll(`*hll*`)`

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
|*hll*| `string` | :heavy_check_mark:| An expression generated by [hll](hll-aggregation-function.md) or [hll-merge](hll-merge-aggregation-function.md) to be used to find the distinct count.|

## Returns

Returns the distinct count of each value in *hll*.

## Example

The following example shows the distinct count hll merged results.
