# Query operators

A query is a read-only operation against data ingested into your cluster. Queries always run in the context of a particular database in the cluster. They may also refer to data in another database, or even in another cluster.

As ad-hoc query of data is the top-priority scenario for Kusto, the Kusto Query Language syntax is optimized for non-expert users authoring and running queries over their data and being able to understand unambiguously what each query does (logically).

The language syntax is that of a data flow, where "data" means "tabular data" (data in one or more rows/columns rectangular shape). At a minimum, a query consists of source data references (references to Kusto tables) and one or more **query operators** applied in sequence, indicated visually by the use of a pipe character (`|`) to delimit operators.

For example:

:::moniker range="azure-data-explorer"
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> <a href="https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/help/databases/Samples?query=H4sIAAAAAAAAAwsuyS/KdS1LzSspVuDlqlEoz0gtSlUILkksSVWwtVVQd/PxD/J0cVRXSMxLAQkXlYRk5qYq2CmkAFWUAJkaRgYGBroGhkCkCTIgOb80rwQATWE/B1YAAAA=" target="_blank">Run the query</a>
::: moniker-end

```kusto
StormEvents 
| where State == 'FLORIDA' and StartTime > datetime(2000-01-01)
| count
```

Each filter prefixed by the pipe character `|` is an instance of an *operator*, with some parameters. The input to the operator is the table that is the result of the preceding pipeline. In most cases, any parameters are [scalar expressions](scalar-data-types/index.md) over the columns of the input.
In a few cases, the parameters are the names of input columns, and in a few cases, the parameter is a second table. The result of a query is always a table, even if it only has one column and one row.

`T` is used in query to denote the preceding pipeline or source table.
