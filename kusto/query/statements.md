# Query statement types

> [!INCLUDE [applies](../includes/applies-to-version/applies.md)] [!INCLUDE [fabric](../includes/applies-to-version/fabric.md)] [!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer](../includes/applies-to-version/azure-data-explorer.md)] [!INCLUDE [monitor](../includes/applies-to-version/monitor.md)] [!INCLUDE [sentinel](../includes/applies-to-version/sentinel.md)]

A query consists of one or more **query statements**, delimited by a semicolon (`;`).
At least one of these query statements must be a [tabular expression statement](tabular-expression-statements.md).
The tabular expression statement generates one or more tabular results. Any two statements must be separated by a semicolon.
When the query has more than one tabular expression statement, the query has a [batch](batches.md) of tabular expression statements, and the tabular results generated by these statements are all returned by the query.

Two types of query statements:

* Statements that are primarily used by users ([user query statements](#user-query-statements)),
* Statements that have been designed to support scenarios in which mid-tier applications take user queries and send a modified version of them to Kusto ([application query statements](#application-query-statements)).

Some query statements are useful in both scenarios.

> [!NOTE]
> The "effect" of a query statement starts at the point where the statement
> appears in the query and ends at the end of the query. Once the query completes,
> all its resources are released and it has no impact on future queries (other than
> side-effects, such as having the query recorded in a log of all queries run,
> or having its results cached.)

## User query statements

Following is a list of user query statements:

* A [let statement](let-statement.md) defines a binding between a name and an expression.
  Let statements can be used to break a long query into small named parts that are easier to
  understand.

* A [set statement](set-statement.md) sets a request property that affects how the query
  is processed and its results returned.

* A [tabular expression statement](tabular-expression-statements.md), the most important
  query statement, returns the "interesting" data back as results.

## Application query statements

Following is a list of application query statements:

* An [alias statement](alias-statement.md) defines an alias to another database
  (in the same cluster or on a remote cluster).

* A [pattern statement](pattern-statement.md), which can be used by applications that are
  built on top of Kusto and expose the query language to their users to inject themselves
  into the query name resolution process.

* A [query parameters statement](query-parameters-statement.md), which is used by applications
  that are built on top of Kusto to protect themselves against injection attacks (similar to
  how command parameters protect SQL against SQL injection attacks.)

* A [restrict statement](restrict-statement.md), which is used by applications that are built
  on top of Kusto to restrict queries to a specific subset of data in Kusto (including restricting
  access to specific columns and records.)
